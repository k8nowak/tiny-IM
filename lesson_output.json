    "lessonNarrative": "In this lesson, students deepen their understanding of functions by comparing representations of several functions relating the same pair of quantities. They analyze two or more graphs simultaneously, interpreting their relative features and their average rates of change in context.\nStudents also study comparative statements in function notation, such as \\(A(x) = B(x)\\) or \\(B(10) > A(10)\\), and explain them in terms of changes in population, changes in the trends of phone ownership, and the popularity of different television shows. Particular attention is given\u00a0to any intersection points between graphs as places where two functions share an output value for the same input value.\nMaking comparisons involves looking beyond individual pieces of information. To accurately relate the information from multiple representations requires careful and precise use of mathematical language and notation (MP6). Students continue reasoning abstractly and quantitatively (MP2) as they use their analyses of representations of functions to draw conclusions about the quantities in situations.",

Because no concrete information is given, students need to rely on their understanding of function notation and points on a graph to make comparisons and to interpret intersections of the graphs.\nPreviously, students saw equations such as \\(f(8) = g(8)\\) and interpreted them in terms of a situation. Here, they begin to reason more abstractly about statements of the form \\(f(x) = g(x)\\) and relate them to one or more points where the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) intersect.

Because no concrete information is given, students need to rely on their understanding of function notation and points on a graph to make comparisons and to interpret intersections of the graphs.\nPreviously, students saw equations such as \\(f(8) = g(8)\\) and interpreted them in terms of a situation. Here, they begin to reason more abstractly about statements of the form \\(f(x) = g(x)\\) and relate them to one or more points where the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) intersect. They see that a value of \\(x\\) that makes this equation true, or a solution to the equation, is the input value of such an intersection.",

                "Activity Synthesis": "Display the graphs of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) for all to see. Invite students to share their responses to the first set of questions. As they point out the greater function value in each pair, mark the point on the graph and write a corresponding statement in function notation: \\(f(2) < g(2)\\), \\(f(4) = g(4)\\), \\(f(6) > g(6)\\), and \\(f(8)>g(8)\\). Emphasize that the function value that is greater in each pair has a higher vertical value on the coordinate plane for the same input value.\nNext, discuss if there are values of \\(x\\) that make \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) true and how we can tell. Point out that earlier we wrote \\(f(4)=g(4)\\) because the values of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are equal when the input is 4. This means that \\((4,f(4))\\) and \\((4,g(4))\\) are coordinates of the same point.\nSo we can interpret an equation such as \\(f(x)=g(x)\\) to mean that the values of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are equal when the input is \\(x\\), and that \\(x\\) must be the horizontal value of the intersection of both graphs, which is a point that they share.\nLesson Synthesis\nRefer back to the population graphs for Baltimore and Cleveland from 1900 to 2010, which students saw in the Warm-up.
