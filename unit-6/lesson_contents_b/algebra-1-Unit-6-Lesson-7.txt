# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
In this lesson, students examine the meaning of negative exponents in context. In these situations, a value of \(t\) that is less than 0 corresponds to a time before the initial measurement, while a value of \(t\) that is greater than 0 refers to a time after the measurement. Students write equations given a table, and then use those equations to answer questions, which requires working with negative values representing time. In one case, students also produce a graph. As with many other activities in this unit, the mathematical work is grounded and interpreted in a context (MP2).
An optional activity here addresses the difficulties inherent in producing graphs representing exponential change, namely that the graphing window has to be selected carefully in order for the graph to be useful. The savvy setting of a graphing window is an important skill when using graphing technology, and intentionally addressing this skill puts students in a better position to use technology strategically in the future.

Coral in the Sea
### Activity Narrative
"""
Up to this point in the unit, students have written and interpreted equations representing exponential change that were meaningful for non-negative input values. In this lesson, they interpret the meaning of a negative value in a context. The independent variable is time, \(t\), so negative values of \(t\) refer to times before \(t\) is 0.
For the last question, to find the time when the coral had the given volume, students may:
Calculate the values of \(y\) when \(t\) is -3, -4, -5, and so on or extend the table of values, if they previously created one, until they reach 37.5 or a value close to it.
Repeatedly divide by 2 (or multiply by \(\frac12\)) the value of \(y\) when \(t\) is -2 until it approaches or hits 37.5.
Use the equation \(1,\!200 \boldcdot 2^t = 37.5\) to find the value of \(2^t\) and then reason about \(t\) from there.
Have students present in this order to support moving their understanding from concrete to abstract.
Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).

Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage them to think quietly about the questions before discussing with their partner. Creating a table or spreadsheet may help students organize the work in the second question. If needed, encourage students to do so.
Select students who used each strategy described in the Activity Narrative, and ask them to share later. Aim to elicit both key mathematical ideas and a variety of student contributions, especially from students who haven't shared recently.

Write an equation of the form \(y=a \boldcdot b^t\) representing the relationship, where \(t\) is the time in years since the coral was measured, and \(y\) is the volume of coral in cubic centimeters. (You need to figure out what numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are in this situation.)
Find the volume of the coral when \(t\) is 5, 1, 0, -1, and -2.
What does it mean, in this situation, when \(t\) is -2?
In a certain year, the volume of the coral is 37.5 cubic centimeters. Which year is this? Explain your reasoning.

### Building on Student Thinking

Students may struggle to think of how to start finding the values for \(a\) and \(b\). Suggest that they make a table of corresponding values of \(t\) and \(y\), and that they think about starting with \(t\) and calculating \(y\).

"""
"""
### Activity Synthesis
Review how students found an equation, \(y = 1,\!200 \boldcdot 2^t\), to represent the volume of coral. Make sure that they recall that the 1,200 represents the 1,200 cubic centimeters of coral when it was first measured and that the 2 indicates the doubling of its volume each year.
Invite previously selected groups to share their solutions to the last question. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.
Connect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions such as:
“Which strategy would be best if we wanted to know the volume of coral when \(t = \text{-}3\) or \(t=2\)? What about when \(t = \text{-}100\) or \(t=100\)?” (For \(t\) values close to the ones known like -3 or 2, it is probably easiest to either multiply or divide by 2. If the \(t\) value is far from known volumes like 100 or -100, using the equation would be easier than multiplying or dividing by 2 so many times.)
“In this situation, what do each of the values mean in the equation \(150 = 1,\!200\boldcdot 2^{\text{-}3}\)?” (3 years before the coral was measured to be 1,200 cubic centimeters, its volume was 150 cubic centimeters).
“How did you estimate or find when the volume of the coral was 37.5 cubic centimeters?”
It may be helpful to display a graph of \(y = 1,\!200 \boldcdot 2^t\), such as the one embedded in the digital version of these materials. Display the graph (either with or without the points from the table plotted), and ask students to identify the volume of coral when \(t\) is -3 and the time when the volume of coral is 37.5 cubic centimeters.
Consider using technology to display the points corresponding to the values calculated in the task. Ask students to gesture at points on the graph corresponding to questions in the activity. Then, turn on the function and the point where \(t=\text{-}3\) for demonstration. Remember that if you click on a plotted point, its coordinates are revealed.

Windows of Graphs
### Activity Narrative
"""
The goal of this activity is to address a skill important to successfully using graphing technology: choosing an appropriate graphing window. Students are given three graphs representing a relationship from an earlier task. They comment on their effectiveness in representing the relationship and consider ways to adjust the graphing window to improve the information that the graph shows.
Choosing an appropriate window for a graph that represents a situation characterized by exponential change can be challenging. Because exponential functions eventually grow very quickly, if the window is too small or too large, then the function may not be visible or may not show features that are interesting. Students could use an interactive graphing tool to experiment and to decide on an appropriate graphing window. It is also helpful, however, to consider the context, the initial amount, and the growth factor.
"""
### Launch
"""
After analyzing three attempts at graphing, students are instructed to use graphing technology to create a version that is better. Provide access to graphing technology (Desmos is available under Math Tools). Students may need instructions or a refresher on how to change the graphing window in the technology they are using before they can be successful with this task.
"""
### Student Task Statement
"""
The volume, \(y\), of coral in cubic centimeters is modeled by the equation \(y = 1,\!200 \boldcdot 2^x\) where \(x\) is the number of years since the coral was measured. Three students used graphing technology to graph the equation that represents the volume of coral as a function of time.

"""
### Building on Student Thinking
"""
Some students might not know how to begin to gauge the fitness of a graphing window. Encourage them to consider whether the quantity of interest is increasing over time or decreasing over time, and how this information might be conveyed by the graph. For example, this can help students decide whether the vertical intercept should be near the top or bottom of the graph.
Students might also make a table of values to find the \(y\)-values when \(x\) is 1, 2, and 3. Prompt them to discuss whether those points show up on each of the three graphs and whether those points are needed to show how the quantities are changing—and, if so, how to adjust the graphing window to show the points.
"""

"""
### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share their observations of the three graphs and their suggestions for improving the readability or meaningfulness of a graph. Discuss questions such as:
“What are the domain and range of a function?” (The domain is all the input values that make sense in the function. The range is all the output values that could result from each of the input values in the domain.)
“To graph the coral structure for 5 years, what would be a reasonable graphing window?”
“If we want to graph the coral structure for 10 years, what would be a reasonable graphing window, assuming that the equation is still valid?”
“What happens if the range we choose is too small, for example, 10,000?”
“What happens if the range we choose is too large, for example, 100,000,000?”
Consider showing students, using your graphing technology of choice, how the graph changes when the horizontal dimension is 10 years and the vertical dimension is adjusted from 10,000, to 100,000, to 1,000,000 (as in Graph B), and then to 10,000,000 cubic centimeters.

Ghost Town Population
### Activity Narrative

In this activity, students use a description and table of values to write an equation that represents the situation. Then, they interpret the equation for negative values of the exponent and produce a graph. They also interpret the numbers in the equation in terms of the context.
For the final question, only an estimate is possible. Expect different answers that range between 1897 and 1898, as a more precise answer cannot be given right now. Look for students who use the graph and try to extend it to values in between integer years. Invite them to share during the discussion.
Throughout this activity, students are building skills that will help them in mathematical modeling (MP4). They don't decide which model to use, but they make connections between representations In the Activity Synthesis, they consider what input values for the model do and do not make sense for their equation.
"""
### Launch
"""
Launch this activity by asking students what they know about ghost towns or if they have ever visited one. Invite 3–5 students to share what they know. Make sure that students understand that ghost towns were once flourishing towns that are now abandoned. Ghost towns can happen due to natural or human-caused disasters. For example, one might happen if a necessary resource, like water, is exhausted, or for economic reasons, like factories shutting down. As a connection to local history, if there are any ghost towns nearby, consider sharing the reasons that the town was abandoned.
If students continue to use graphing technology while working on this task, they are likely to enter their equation and see a smooth curve. It is not the intention that they try to sketch a curve at this time. Draw their attention to the instructions that say to plot the points.

### Activity Synthesis
The goal of this discussion is to highlight some aspects of mathematical modeling. In particular, considering the reasonableness of a model and choices about how to visualize a model by graphing points or a line.
To demonstrate how the model is less reliable when using inputs that are far from the data, have half the class calculate and interpret \(p(70)\) and the other half calculate and interpret \(p(\text{-}70)\). They will find that in 1970 the population is 0.94 (or 1 if they round to the nearest person) and in 1830 the population is 2,393,953. Neither of these are reasonable.
Here are some questions for discussion:
“Explain if it would be reasonable to use this model to:	“Estimate the town’s population in 1910.” (Yes, that year is close to the data given in the table and the Task Statement said that the pattern continues until the mid-1950’s, so it would be reasonable to use this model to estimate the population in 1910.)“Estimate the town’s population in 1890.” (No, the town’s population was at its greatest in 1895, but using an exponential model would put the population in 1890 as greater than the population in 1895.)“Estimate when the town’s population will be 0.” (No, that year will be far from the data given in the table, and models are less reliable farther from the known data.)
“Estimate the town’s population in 1910.” (Yes, that year is close to the data given in the table and the Task Statement said that the pattern continues until the mid-1950’s, so it would be reasonable to use this model to estimate the population in 1910.)
“Estimate the town’s population in 1890.” (No, the town’s population was at its greatest in 1895, but using an exponential model would put the population in 1890 as greater than the population in 1895.)
“Estimate when the town’s population will be 0.” (No, that year will be far from the data given in the table, and models are less reliable farther from the known data.)
“When calculating the town’s population in 1895, your answer was a decimal. Why was it reasonable to round the answer?” (Population is a measure of people, so it can only be a whole number.)
Conclude with a discussion about input values between the integers, which later lessons will expand on. Ask students to recall their answer to the value of \(t\) when the town had 2000 people and if they think non-integer inputs make sense in this context. (Yes, because numbers between the integers are different times in the year.).
If students still have access to graphing technology for this activity, tell them to enter their equation and see the curve for themselves or display these graphs for all to see.

Image description: A graph showing $p$ over $t$ with the graph of $p=1500\boldcdot(\frac{9}{10})^t$.
Explain that if the population is plotted at time intervals smaller than 1 year, the graph may look like the first graph. Another option is to graph a relationship where a quantity changes continuously using a curve. Students will focus on non-integer domain values in upcoming lessons, so there is no need to discuss the meaning of non-integer inputs in depth at this time.
# Lesson Close

We looked at some situations where negative values representing times are meaningful. Review how we can use equations to understand a quantity before and after a certain time.

If time permits, draw a set of axes for all to see, and plot points corresponding to the values shared by students.
"""
## Student Lesson Summary
"""
Equations are useful not only for representing relationships that change exponentially, but also for answering questions about these situations.
Suppose a bacteria population of 1,000,000 has been increasing by a factor of 2 every hour. What was the size of the population 5 hours ago? How many hours ago was the population less than 1,000?
We could go backward and calculate the population of bacteria 1 hour ago, 2 hours ago, and so on. For example, if the population doubled each hour and was 1,000,000 when first observed, an hour before then it must have been 500,000, and two hours before then it must have been 250,000, and so on.
Another way to reason through these questions is by representing the situation with an equation. If \(t\) measures time in hours since the population was 1,000,000, then the bacteria population can be described by the equation:
\(\displaystyle p = 1,\!000,\!000 \boldcdot 2^t\)
The population is 1,000,000 when \(t\) is 0, so 5 hours earlier, \(t\) would be -5 and here is a way to calculate the population:
\(\displaystyle \begin{align} 1,\!000,\!000 \boldcdot 2^{\text-5} &= 1,\!000,\!000 \boldcdot \frac{1}{2^5} \\ &= 1,\!000,\!000 \boldcdot \frac{1}{32} \\ &= 31,\!250 \end{align}\)
Likewise, substituting -10 for \(t\) gives us \(1,\!000,\!000 \boldcdot 2^{\text-10}\) (or \(1,\!000,\!000 \boldcdot \frac{1}{2^{10}}\)), which is a little less than 1,000. This means that 10 hours before the initial measurement the bacteria population was less than 1,000.
