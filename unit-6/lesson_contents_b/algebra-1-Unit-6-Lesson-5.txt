# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
This lesson continues to examine quantities that decrease exponentially. They use the distributive property to rewrite expressions in which a quantity decreases by a factor of itself. For example, a \$500 computer that loses \(\frac{1}{5}\) of its value each year could be written as \(500 - \frac{1}{5} \boldcdot 500\) or as \(500 \boldcdot \frac{4}{5}\). An expression using only multiplication is easier to extend to multiple applications of the growth factor.
Using an exponent to express repeated decrease by the same factor is a good example of a generalization based on repeated calculation (MP8). Writing \(500 \boldcdot \left(\frac45\right)^t\) expresses the computation of repeatedly decreasing by \(\frac15\), \(t\) times.
"""
## Learning Goals
Use only multiplication to represent “decreasing a quantity by some fraction of itself.”
Comprehend that the term "exponential growth" describes a quantity that changes by a growth factor that is greater than 1, and the term “exponential decay” describes a quantity that changes by a growth factor that is less than 1 but greater than 0.
Write an expression or an equation to represent a situation where a quantity decays exponentially.
## Student-Facing Goal
Let’s look at exponential decay.
## Student-Facing Targets
I can use only multiplication to represent "decreasing a quantity by a fraction of itself."
I know the meanings of “exponential growth” and “exponential decay.”
I can write an expression or equation to represent a quantity that decays exponentially.

The purpose of this Warm-up is to recognize linear and exponential patterns that involve fractions, which will be useful when students write expressions to represent these patterns in a later activity. While students may notice and wonder many things about these tables, the linear and exponential patterns are the important discussion points.

### Activity Synthesis
Ask students to share the things they noticed and wondered. Record and display their responses, without editing or commentary, for all to see. If possible, record the relevant reasoning on or near the tables. Next, ask students, “Is there anything on this list that you are wondering about now?” Encourage students to observe what is on display and to respectfully ask for clarification, point out contradicting information, or voice any disagreement.
If the way that the values in the tables change from row to row does not come up during the conversation, ask students to discuss this idea.
If no students wonder about whether the values in the two tables will ever agree again, ask, “Will a linear growth and an exponential growth that start with the same value have the same value again at some later point?” Consider posting the question for students to think about throughout the unit.

What's Left?

"""
In this activity, students use the distributive property to rewrite an expression that involves a difference and turn it into an expression that uses only multiplication. They examine and explain a worked example, and then they practice using the method to rewrite expressions.
"""
### Launch
"""
Ask students to close their books or devices. Pose this question:
Diego has \$100 and spends \(\frac14\) of it. How much does he have left?
Give students a minute to think about it, and then ask a few students to share their answer and their reasoning.
"""
### Student Task Statement
"""
Here is one way to think about how much Diego has left after spending \(\frac14\) of \$100. Explain each step.	Step 1: \(100 - \frac14 \boldcdot 100\)Step 2: \(100\left(1 - \frac14\right)\)Step 3: \(100 \boldcdot \frac34\)Step 4: \(\frac34 \boldcdot 100\)
Step 1: \(100 - \frac14 \boldcdot 100\)
Step 2: \(100\left(1 - \frac14\right)\)
Step 3: \(100 \boldcdot \frac34\)
Step 4: \(\frac34 \boldcdot 100\)
A person makes \$1,800 per month, but \(\frac13\) of that amount goes to her rent. What two numbers can you multiply to find out how much she has after paying her rent?
Write an expression that uses only multiplication and that is equivalent to \(x\) reduced by \(\frac18\) of \(x\).
"""
### Building on Student Thinking
"""
Students may have trouble making the connection between the fraction that is being subtracted and the fraction that remains when the subtraction is rewritten as multiplication. Invite these students to think through the steps in Diego's calculation. What does the number 100 represent? What about the \(\frac{1}{3}\)? After students identify the analogous quantities in the second and third questions, encourage them to revisit the subsequent steps of Diego's calculation.

"""
### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share their explanation of the steps in the first question and how they used similar reasoning for the other situations. Make sure that students understand that a decreasing quantity can be expressed both ways, using subtraction or multiplication.
Reinforce the steps used in the first question by using this example: “There were \(x\) dogs at the park and \(\frac{1}{5}\) of the dogs were on a leash. How many dogs were not on a leash?” Tell students that the number of dogs not on a leash could be expressed, using subtraction, as \(x - \frac{1}{5}x\), but that's not a handy way to express it when working with a situation that is changing by a constant factor. Instead, we can factor that expression and write it as \(x(1 - \frac{1}{5})\) to more clearly show how the value is changing over time. After combining terms and using the commutative property, we have an expression using only multiplication.
Emphasize that it is important to be able to express this situation using multiplication because exponential situations involve quantities changing by a common factor (or being multiplied by a number).

Value of a Vehicle
### Activity Narrative
"""
In this activity, students examine a situation in which a quantity decreases by repeated multiplication by the same factor. They represent the pattern of decrease with an equation and interpret the different parts of the equation in terms of the context (the depreciation of a car). The definition of growth factor is expanded to accommodate situations involving decrease.
"""
### Launch
"""
Arrange students in groups of 2. Introduce the context of depreciation. Use Co-Craft Questions to orient students to the context and to elicit possible mathematical questions.
Display only the problem stem and related image, without revealing the questions. Give students 1–2 minutes to write a list of mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation, before comparing questions with a partner.
Invite several partners to share one question with the class, and record their responses. Ask the class to make comparisons among the shared questions and their own. Ask, “What do these questions have in common? How are they different?” Listen for and amplify language related to the learning goal, such as “losing value” and “decrease.”
Reveal the questions, and give students 1–2 minutes to compare it to their own question and to those of their classmates. Invite students to identify similarities and differences by asking:	“Which of your questions is most similar to or different from the ones provided? Why?”
“Which of your questions is most similar to or different from the ones provided? Why?”
Clarify to students that they may complete the table with numerical expressions that show how to find the values rather than with the results of evaluating the expressions.
After groups complete the second question, discuss their solution as a whole class. If needed, remind students of the method for using the distributive property to write \(18,\!000 - 18,\!000 \boldcdot \frac{1}{3} = 18,\!000 \boldcdot \frac{2}{3}\). Students should understand that process and the connection that losing one third of its value means that the car is still worth two thirds of its value. When students are comfortable with this understanding, tell them to proceed with the other questions.

"""
### Activity Synthesis
The purpose of the discussion is for students to understand that when a quantity is decreased by a fraction \(r\) with \(0 < r < 1\), the quantity is multiplied by \((1- r)\) to find the reduced value.
Questions for discussion:
“Why does it make sense to multiply an entry in one row by \(\frac{2}{3}\) to get the entry for the next row?” (Each year, only \(\frac23\) of the car value remains.)
“Why not write the expression for each year as subtraction, for instance, \(18,\!000 - \frac13 \boldcdot 18,\!000\)?” (We could, but writing subtraction can get unwieldy quickly. For year 2, the expression would be \((18,\!000 - \frac13 \boldcdot 18,\!000) - \frac13 (18,\!000 - \frac13 \boldcdot 18,\!000)\). If we calculate the value of each term it would be simpler (\(12,\!000 - \frac13 \boldcdot 12,\!000\)), but it would still not allow us to see a pattern and write a general expression as easily.)
“Does the \(\frac45\) in the last equation mean losing \(\frac45\) of the value each year? Why or why not?” (No. Multiplying by \(\frac 45\) repeatedly means each time only \(\frac45\) of the value remains, so the car is losing \(\frac15\) of its value each year.)
“Will the value of the second car (starting at \$10,000 and losing \(\frac{1}{5}\) of it each year) ever be worth more than the first car (starting at \$18,000 and losing \(\frac{1}{3}\) of it each year)? Explain.” (Yes. After 4 years, the value of the second car will be \$4,096 while the value of the first car will be \$3,555.56)
Make sure that students understand that the exponential expression for the value of the cars after \(t\) years came from multiplying by the growth factor (\(\frac23\), or $\frac\(\frac{4}{5}\)$) repeatedly (\(t\) times).

"""
We studied quantities that decrease or decay by the same factor repeatedly. Use examples from activities in the lesson, or a new example like this one.
Suppose a digital camera worth \$400 loses \(\frac{1}{3}\) of its value each year.
How can we express the value of the camera, in dollars, after one year? After two years?
Why might it make sense to use only multiplication (instead of subtraction and multiplication) to show the value of the camera over time?
When we use only multiplication, why doesn’t the \(\frac13\) show up in the expression?
What is the value of the camera, in dollars, after \(t\) years?

## Student Lesson Summary
"""
Sometimes a quantity grows by the same factor at regular intervals. For example, a population might double every year. Sometimes a quantity decreases by the same factor at regular intervals. For example, a car might lose one third of its value every year.
Let's look at a situation in which the quantity decreases by the same factor at regular intervals. Suppose a bacteria population starts at 100,000, and \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the population dies each day. The population one day later is \(100,\!000 - \frac14 \boldcdot 100,\!000\), which can be written as \(100,\!000 \left(1 - \frac14\right)\). The population after one day is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of 100,000 or 75,000. The population after two days is \(\frac{3}{4} \boldcdot 75,\!000\). Here are some further values for the bacteria population
numberof days | bacteria population
0 | 100,000
1 | 75,000 (or \(100,\!000 \boldcdot \frac34\))
2 | 56,250 (or \(100,\!000 \boldcdot \frac34 \boldcdot \frac34\), or \(100,\!000 \boldcdot \left(\frac34\right)^2\))
3 | about 42,188 (or \(100,\!000 \boldcdot \frac34 \boldcdot \frac34 \boldcdot \frac34\), or \(100,\!000 \boldcdot \left(\frac34\right)^3\))
In general, \(d\) days after the bacteria population was 100,000, the population \(p\) is given by the equation: \(\displaystyle p = 100,\!000 \boldcdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^d,\) with one factor of \(\frac{3}{4}\) for each day.
Situations with quantities that decrease exponentially are described with the term exponential decay. The multiplier (\(\frac34\) in this case) is still called the growth factor, though sometimes people call it the decay factor instead.
