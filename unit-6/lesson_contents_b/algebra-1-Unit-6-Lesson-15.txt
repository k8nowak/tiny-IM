# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
This is the first of several lessons that develop students' ability to use exponential expressions (and eventually functions) to model repeated interest calculations. Students graph the associated exponential functions for different interest rates. Though the term compounding is not yet used with students, the activities help students see that, in the context of borrowing money, high interest rates and compounding do not favor the borrower. In later lessons, students will learn that the same mechanisms can be favorable in the context of saving money.
To represent compounded interest with an exponential expression or an exponential function, students need to realize that the process of repeatedly applying, say, 5% interest \(n\) times, is the same as multiplying by \((1.05)^n\). This is an example of looking for and expressing regularity in repeated reasoning (MP8).
"""
## Learning Goals

### Activity Narrative
"""
In this activity, students see a situation in which a percent change is applied twice, first on the initial amount, and then on the amount that results from the first percent change. The multiplicative way of expressing the change is particularly helpful in such a situation. The example uses a familiar context of sales and discounts. The repeated decay results from applying a factor that is less than 1 more than once.

### Activity Synthesis
Students may have chosen to calculate the price after each discount separately. For instance, they may have found the cost after the first discount to be \$24 (because \(32 \boldcdot (0.75)=24\), or \(32 - (0.25) \boldcdot 32=24\)), and then calculated \(24 \boldcdot (0.75)\), or \(24 - (0.25) \boldcdot 24\). To help them see the repeated multiplication by a factor, consider recording their steps without evaluating any step.
Focus the discussion on different expressions that can be used to efficiently calculate the final cost of the book, for instance:
\(32 \boldcdot (0.75) \boldcdot (0.75)\)
\((0.75) \boldcdot (0.75) \boldcdot 32\)
\(\frac{3}{4} \boldcdot \left( \frac{3}{4} \boldcdot 32\right)\)

Owing Interests
### Activity Narrative
"""
In this activity, students use exponential expressions to describe and make sense of repeated percent increase in a borrowing context. An essential point here is that, in each repetition, the value being increased by a percent is not the same as the initial value. Instead, it includes previous increases.
To express this repetition more generally, it is important for students to represent the percent increase using multiplication. For example, if a baseball card is valued at \$15 and increases in value by 10% each year, there are many ways to write the value of the card, in dollars, after one year including:
\(16.50\)
\(15 + 1.50\)
\(15 + (0.1) \boldcdot 15\)
\(15 \boldcdot (1+0.1)\)
\(15 \boldcdot (1.1)\)
The first three expressions are not particularly helpful for finding the value after 2 years or 3 years. The last two expressions, however, can be applied any number of times, giving the value, after \(t\) years:
\(15 \boldcdot (1+0.1)^t\)
\(15 \boldcdot (1.1)^t\)
Look for students who write expressions using multiplication, and invite them to share during the discussion. Note that the expression \(15 \boldcdot(1+0.1)^t\) is a very important way to express a 10 percent increase, even though it involves addition, because it calls attention to the percent increase. It is sometimes generalized to formulas such as \(P \boldcdot (1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}\), although that formula is not presented in these materials. If any students write 1.18 as \((1 + 0.18)\) in this task, make sure to invite them to share during the discussion.

Ask students what they know about how loans work. If students are unfamiliar with the idea of interest on loans, give a brief overview. Explain that a person or a bank may lend money to someone who needs it. In return, the lender would collect interest, which is a percentage of the loan, until the loan is paid. For instance, if Person A decides to borrow \$400 from a lender at a 10% interest rate calculated yearly, then after one year Person A will need to pay the lender \(400 \boldcdot (0.1)\) or \$40 in interest, in addition to returning the borrowed amount.
Arrange students in groups of 2. After the second question, discuss:
How did you calculate the amounts in year 1, 2, and 3? (I found the amount owed after 1 year, then applied the interest to that value for the amount owed in year 2, then again for year 3.)
Could you have found the amount in year 2 without calculating year 1? Could you have found the amount in year 3 without year 2? (Yes, applying a growth factor of \((1+0.18)\) or 1.18 multiple times would result in the same solution.)
After the 1st read, say, “Tell your partner what this situation is about.”
After the 2nd read, say, “List the quantities. What can be counted or measured?”
For the 3rd read, reveal and read the questions. Ask, “What are some ways we might get started on this?”

"""
### Activity Synthesis
The discussion should aim to clarify the path toward the final expression \(450\boldcdot (1.18)^x\). Here is one way to clarify how the process of finding the amount owed for any year could be generalized, and how the generalized expression simplifies the calculation:
Year 1
\(\begin {align} [\text{Year 1 Amount}] &= [\text{Starting Amount}] + [\text{Starting Amount}] \boldcdot 0.18\\ &=450 + 450 \boldcdot (0.18)\\ &=450 \boldcdot (1+0.18)\\ &=450 \boldcdot (1.18)\\ \end {align}\)
Year 2
\(\begin {align} \text{[Year 2 Amount]} &= \text{[Year 1 Amount]} + \text{[Year 1 Amount]} \boldcdot (0.18)\\ &=[450\boldcdot (1.18)] + [450 \boldcdot(1.18)] \boldcdot (0.18)\\ &=[450 \boldcdot(1.18)] \boldcdot (1+0.18)\\ &=450\boldcdot(1.18)\boldcdot(1.18)\\ \end {align}\)
Year 3
\(\begin {align} \text{[Year 3 Amount]} &= \text{[Year 2 Amount]} + \text{[Year 2 Amount]} \boldcdot (0.18)\\ &=[450\boldcdot(1.18)\boldcdot(1.18)] + [450\boldcdot(1.18)\boldcdot(1.18)] \boldcdot (0.18)\\ &=[450\boldcdot(1.18)\boldcdot(1.18)] \boldcdot (1+0.18)\\ &=450\boldcdot(1.18)\boldcdot(1.18)\boldcdot(1.18)\\ &=450\boldcdot(1.18)^3\\ \end {align}\)
Year \(x\)
\(\text{[Year } x \text{ Amount]}=450\boldcdot (1.18)^x\)
Discuss questions (for the Year 2 calculations) such as:
“In Step 2, what does the 450 (1.18)(0.18) represent?” (It represents the amount of interest added in the second year.)
“In Step 3, how does the (1 + 0.18) come about?” (Because both things being added had \([450 \boldcdot (1.18)]\), the expression could be rewritten using the distributive property with that part multiplied by the sum \((1+0.18)\).)
“In Step 4, how can we interpret the \((1.18)\boldcdot(1.18)\)?” (This means that the new amount owed after 2 years is 100% of the initial amount as well as 18% interest applied twice.)
Make sure students understand the meaning of each part of the final expression \(450 \boldcdot (1.18)^x\) in terms of the context:
450 is the loan amount in dollars.
1.18 is how much the amount owed on the loan changes after each year. Because no other payments are made, the initial balance is unchanged (this is the 1) and the 18% interest is applied on that initial balance (this is the 0.18).
\(x\) represents the number of years the 18% interest has been applied.

Comparing Loans
### Activity Narrative
"""
Students continue to explore financial situations that involve repeated percent increase. They compare the effects of repeatedly applying different interest rates to a balance and graph the balances to see the  amount owed over time. Students see that higher interest rates have an increasingly dramatic effect when compounded over many years on an unpaid balance.
When graphing the functions, choosing an appropriate window may be challenging because the functions grow at very different rates. A small domain and range may appropriately show the 12% loan, but the same domain and range can result in the graphs for the 24% and 30.6% loans leaving the screen quickly. A large domain and range may appropriately show the 30.6% loan balance but make the 12% loan balance rate look constant.
Students could experiment with different domain and range values, though that may not be efficient. Prompt them to consider calculating the values of some expressions in the table to help them set an appropriate window for showing all three graphs meaningfully.
Students will likely produce continuous graphs although in the context the number of years is a whole number. The continuous graphs help to visualize how the different interest rates influence the balance. If some students plot only the end-of-year balances, consider inviting them to share their graphs during the discussion.

### Activity Synthesis
Select groups to share their responses. To involve more students in the discussion, ask if others obtained the same results or reasoned the same way. If not, invite them to share their responses or approaches.
Review the meaning of the expressions for the loan balance after \(x\) years without payment. Make sure students understand that, for instance, the balance of the 12% loan after \(x\) years is \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.12)^x\) because the initial \$1,000 is multiplied by 1.12 \(x\) times, once for each year that the 12% interest is charged.
Display the graphs for all to see. Use them to highlight the effect that the different interest rates have on the owed amount, especially when the loan is left unpaid for a long period of time. This will be a recurring theme in the next several lessons. Also make sure that students can use the graphs to estimate the time that it takes each loan balance to double.

# Lesson Close
## Lesson Synthesis
"""
We looked at how to express repeated interest calculations in this lesson. Present a simple example to help students synthesize what they learned.
Suppose a homeowner borrows \$2,000 from a lender that charges 4% interest on the unpaid balance at the end of every year, and the homeowner does not make any payments.
Discuss questions such as:
“What expressions can we write to show the amount owed after 1 year and 2 years? After \(t\) years?” (For 1 year, \(2000 \boldcdot (1 + 0.04)\). For 2 years, \(2000 \boldcdot (1 + 0.04)^2\). For \(t\) years, \(2000 \boldcdot (1+0.04)^t\).)
“To find the interest owed after 3 years, can we simply triple the interest charged after 1 year? Why or why not?” (We cannot just use 12% interest on \$2,000 three times because after each year the new percentage interest is being applied to the original \$2,000 as well as any interest from the previous years.)
“Why can we represent an amount, \(a\), increased by 4% as \(a \boldcdot (1.04)\)? How did the 1.04 come about?” (We can think of 1.04 as 100% of the original cost plus an additional 4% interest, so that the total amount owed is 104% of the original amount borrowed, resulting in multiplying by 1.04.)
"""
## Student Lesson Summary
"""
When we borrow money from a lender, the lender usually charges interest, a percentage of the borrowed amount as payment for allowing us to use the money. The interest is usually calculated at a regular interval of time (for example, daily, monthly, or yearly).
Suppose you received a loan of \$500 and the interest rate is 15%, calculated at the end of each year. If you make no other purchases or payments, the amount owed after one year would be \(500 + (0.15) \boldcdot 500\), or \(500 \boldcdot(1+0.15)\). If you continue to make no payments or other purchases in the second year, the amount owed would increase by another 15%. The table shows the calculation of the amount owed for the first three years.
time in years | amount owed in dollars
1 | \(500 \boldcdot(1+0.15)\)
2 | \(500 \boldcdot(1+0.15)(1+0.15)\), or \(500 \boldcdot(1+0.15)^2\)
3 | \(500 \boldcdot(1+0.15)(1+0.15)(1+0.15)\), or \(500 \boldcdot(1+0.15)^3\)
The pattern here continues. Each additional year means multiplication by another factor of \((1+0.15)\). With no further purchases or payments, after \(t\) years the debt in dollars is given by the expression:
\(\displaystyle 500\boldcdot(1+0.15)^t\)
In this representation, we might leave the growth factor as \((1 + 0.15)\) rather than combining it to 1.15 so that the percentage increase is easier to see. In other situations, it may make sense to write it as 1.15, depending on what is being emphasized. Because exponential functions eventually grow very quickly, leaving a debt unpaid can be very costly.
