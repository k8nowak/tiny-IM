# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
In this lesson, students work to show that linear functions change by equal differences over equal intervals, while exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals. When the interval length is 1, the equal difference is the slope of a linear function. When the interval length is more than 1, the difference is the length of the interval times the slope. For an exponential function \(f\) given by \(f(x) = a \boldcdot b^x\), when the interval length is 1, the factor of growth is \(b\). If the interval length is a whole number \(n\), then the factor of growth is \(b^n\).
In order to justify why linear functions change by equal differences over equal intervals and exponential functions change by equal factors over equal intervals, students observe this structure repeatedly for specific numbers and then generalize this reasoning to apply to all intervals (MP8). Along the way, they need to recognize and use properties of exponents, which is an example of noticing and making use of structure (MP7).

Outputs of a Linear Function
### Activity Narrative
"""
In grade 8, students learned that a linear function has a constant rate of change. Each time the input increases by 1, the output changes by a particular amount, and this amount is called the rate of change of the function. In this activity, students revisit and extend their understanding of this structure. If \(f\) is a linear function, then whenever the input, \(x\), increases by 2, the output always changes by the same amount. The same is true if 2 is replaced by any non-zero quantity. When the input, \(x\), changes by the same quantity, the output \(f(x)\) also changes by the same quantity.
This idea is connected to the fact that a line representing the linear function has a well-defined slope. Look for students who draw slope triangles in order to calculate the differences in \(x\) and \(y\), and invite them to share during the discussion.
"""
### Launch
"""
Tell students that they will now revisit a linear function in order to describe its behavior more generally and clearly. Later, they will compare and contrast this behavior with that of an exponential function.
Arrange students in groups of 2. Give partners a moment to discuss the first question. Consider asking partners to use different pairs of consecutive values when checking how \(f(x)\) changes when \(x\) increases by 1 (for example, one partner uses 1 and 2 for the values of \(x\), and the other partner uses 19 and 20).
Use Critique, Correct, Clarify to give students an opportunity to improve a sample written response for generalizing how a linear function changes whenever \(x\) increases by 1, by correcting errors, clarifying meaning, and adding details.
Display this first draft:	“We checked what happens when \(x\) is 1 and 2, 19 and 20. Because the values increased the same both times, it must always do that.”	Ask, “What parts of this response are unclear, incorrect, or incomplete?” As students respond, annotate the display with 2–3 ideas to indicate the parts of the writing that could use improvement.
Give students 2–4 minutes to work with a partner to revise the first draft.
Display and review these criteria: 	Checking at specific pairs is not enough to make a general statement about something always happening. To prove that a claim must be true for all values, use a variable.For a general statement, it must be true for all pairs of numbers that are 1 apart.Be specific when stating a claim. If possible, avoid words like “it” or “that.”

Select 1–2 individuals or groups to read their revised draft aloud slowly enough to record for all to see. Scribe as each student shares, then invite the whole class to contribute additional language and edits to make the final draft even more clear and more convincing.
Before beginning the additional questions, ask students how to find \(f(x+1)\). If necessary, remind students that \(f(2)\) means to substitute 2 for \(x\), so similarly \(f(x+1)\) means to substitute \((x+1)\) for \(x\). Then point out that, in this example, \(f(x+1) = 2(x+1)+5\) is used in the first part of the expression for the question.

### Building on Student Thinking
"""
If students seem to have trouble making sense of how the expression \([2(x+1) +5] - [2x+5]\) represents the change in \(f(x)\) when \(x\) increases by 1, or how the expression has a value of 2, consider asking them to reason about the expression as if \(x\) and \(x+1\) were numerical expressions (say, 3 and \(3+1\)).
Students may have trouble with the first part of the last question (about how the values of \(f\) change whenever \(x\) increases by 4). Ask them to try several pairs of values (like 1 and 5, 3 and 7, and so on) to see if there is a pattern. Then prompt them to refer to how an increase of 1 was expressed algebraically and rearranged in an earlier question.
Watch for students who overlook the fact that the change in the value of \(x\) must be 1 if the change in the value of \(y\) is the same as the slope.
"""
### Are You Ready for More?
"""
"""
### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share their responses to the last two questions. Relate the algebraic work done in this activity to what students have learned about slope and similar triangles in grade 8. Discuss questions such as:
"Can you find an example where the output of \(f\) does not increase by 2 when \(x\) goes up by 1? Explain your reasoning?" (No. The graph of \(f\), a line, has a particular slope, an amount by which the output value changes when \(x\) changes by 1. So any two points on the line whose \(x\)-values are 1 unit apart will have \(y\)-values that differ by the value of the slope.)
"Can you find an example where the input \(x\) increases by 4, but the output \(f(x)\) does not increase by 8? Explain your reasoning." (No. If increasing the input by 1 always changes the output by 2, then increasing by 1 four times always changes the output by 4 times the slope, or \(4 \boldcdot 2\). Consider showing a graph.)
"How does the expression \([2(x+4)+5]- [2x + 5]\) show that when \(x\) changes by 4, the output changes by 8?" (The \(2(x+4)+5\) is the output of \(f\) for \(x+4\). The \(2x+5\) is the output of \(f\) for \(x\). Subtracting the two gives us: \(2x + 8 + 5 - 2x - 5\), which is 8.)

 </p>
Emphasize that in any linear function, when \(x\) increases by an equal amount, the output also changes by an equal amount.
To further highlight that this observation is true for any linear function, and if time permits, consider showing a diagram of an abstract case of a linear function with slope \(s\).
When the input changes by \(a\), the output changes by \(a \boldcdot s\). (The triangles drawn are similar triangles, so the ratios of their corresponding sides are equivalent.)

Outputs of an Exponential Function
### Activity Narrative
"""
This activity complements the previous one. Students first examine what happens to the values of an exponential function, \(f\), when the input is increased by 1. If \(f\) is an exponential function defined by \(f(x) = a \boldcdot b^x\), then its value changes by a factor of \(b\). Similarly, if the input is increased by 7, then the function value increases by a factor of \(b^7\). More generally, an exponential function always changes by equal factors over equal intervals.
Students may have little trouble recognizing how the output values change when dealing with numerical input values, but may find it challenging to generalize their observations. Focus the discussion on this transition and on using properties of exponents to extend their observations toward generalized cases.
"""
### Launch
"""
When students pause their work, invite students to make a conjecture about what happens when the input is increased by 1. (The value is tripled.)
Remind students that we can check this by looking for a constant factor for all pairs of output values that have input values which are 1 apart. In this case, we can check \(\frac{g(x+1)}{g(x)}\). Invite students to explain how this is equal to 3 for this situation.

### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share what they noticed about values of \(g\) for consecutive whole numbers. If not mentioned by students, point out the pattern that as the \(x\)-value increases by 1, the output changes by a factor of 3. For example: \(g(5)\) is 3 times \(g(4)\), \(g(8)\) is 3 times \(g(7)\), and so on.
Discuss questions such as:
"What do we have when dividing the outputs for two consecutive \(x\)-values, such as \(\frac{g(5)}{g(4)}\) or \(\frac{g(8)}{g(7)}\)?" (A quotient of 3)
"How are the two outputs \(g(x+1)\) and \(g(x)\) related?" (\(g(x+1)\) is \(g(x)\) times 3, or when we divide \(g(x+1)\) by \(g(x)\), the quotient is 3.)
"How can we use the rules of exponents to show that this is always the case?" (\(g(x) = 3^x\), so \(g(x+1) = 3^{x+1}\). When dividing two powers with the same bases, we can subtract the exponents. Dividing the two, we have \(\frac{3^{x+1}}{3^x}\), which is 3.)
"Does this reasoning work if the function has a different initial value, say \(h\) given by \(h(x) = 5 \boldcdot 3^x\)?" (Yes,\(\frac{5\boldcdot 3^{x+1}}{5 \boldcdot 3^x}\) still equals 3.)
"What happens to the output of \(g\) when \(x\) increases by 2?" (\(g(x)\) increases by a factor of 3 twice, or \(3^2\).) What about when it increases by 5? (\(g(x)\) increases by a factor of 3 five times.)
"What happens to the output when \(x\) increases by \(a\)?" (\(g(x)\) increases by a factor of 3 \(a\) times, or \(3^a\). The rule of exponents can help us here as well. If we divide \(g(x+a)\) by \(g(x)\), we have: \(\frac{3^{x+a}}{3^x} = 3^a\).)
Consider using a graph of \(g\) to help students visualize the growth of \(g\) over equal intervals of \(x\). The successive quotients of the outputs are always 3.

"How does the function \(g\) change when \(x\) grows by 1? By 5? By 10?” (It grows by multiplying by 3 raised to the power of each of the values.)
Make sure students see that any time \(x\) increases by 2, \(f\) grows by \(3 \boldcdot 2\) (or 6), and \(g\) grows by a factor \(3^2\) (or 9). Any time \(x\) increases by 5, the value of \(f\) grows by \(3 \boldcdot 5\) (or 15), but the value of \(g\) grows by a factor of \(3^5\) (or 243).
"""
## Student Lesson Summary
"""
Linear and exponential functions each behave in a particular way every time their input value increases by the same amount.
Take the linear function \(f\) defined by \(f(x) = 5x + 3\). The graph of this function has a slope of 5. That means that each time \(x\) increases by 1, \(f(x)\) increases by 5. For example, the points \((7,38)\) and \((8,43)\) are both on the graph. When \(x\) increases by 1 (from 7 to 8), \(y\) increases by 5 (because \(43-38=5\)). We can show algebraically that this is always true, regardless of what value \(x\) takes.
Graph of an increasing linear function, x y plane, origin O. Horizontal axis, scale 0 to 10, by 5’s. Vertical axis, scale 0 to 60, by 20’s. The function starts at (0 comma 3) and goes through (7 comma 38) and (8 comma 43). A horizontal green dashed line over green 1 goes from (7 comma 38) for 1 unt, then up to (8 comma 43) with a green 5 next to it for 5 units.
Image description: <p>Graph of an increasing linear function, x y plane, origin O.</p>
The value of \(f\) when \(x\) increases by 1, or \(f(x+1)\), is \(5(x+1) +3\). Subtracting \(f(x+1)\) and \(f(x)\), we have:
\(\displaystyle \begin {align} f(x+1) - f(x)=5(x+1) + 3 - (5x+3)\\ =5x + 5 +3 -5x-3\\ =5\end{align}\)
This tells us that whenever \(x\) increases by 1, the difference in the output is always 5. In the lesson, we also saw that when \(x\) increases by an amount other than 1, the output always increases by the same amount if the function is linear.
Now let's look at an exponential function \(g\) defined by \(g(x) = 2^x\). If we graph \(g\), we see that each time \(x\) increases by 1, the value \(g(x)\) doubles. We can show algebraically that this is always true, regardless of what value \(x\) takes.
Graph of an increasing exponential function, x y plane, origin O. Horizontal axis, scale 0 to 10, by 5’s. Vertical axis, scale 0 to 60, by 20’s. The function starts at the vertical axis and goes through (3 comma 8), (4 comma 16) and (5 comma 32).
Image description: <p>Graph of an increasing exponential function, x y plane, origin O. </p>
The value of \(g\) when \(x\) increases by 1, or \(g(x+1)\), is \(2^{x+1}\). Dividing \(g(x+1)\) by \(g(x)\), we have:
\(\displaystyle \begin {align} \frac{g(x+1)}{g(x)}=\frac{2^{(x+1)}}{2^x}\\ =2^{x+1-x}\\ =2^1\\ =2\\ \end{align}\)
This means that whenever \(x\) increases by 1, the value of \(g\) always increases by a multiple of 2. In the lesson, we also saw that when \(x\) increases by an amount other than 1, the output always increases by the same factor if the function is exponential.
A linear function always increases (or decreases) by the same amount over equal intervals. An exponential function increases (or decreases) by equal factors over equal intervals.
