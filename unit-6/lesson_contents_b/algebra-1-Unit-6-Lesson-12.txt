# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
In this lesson, students analyze the graph of an exponential function \(f\) given by \(f(x) = a \boldcdot b^x\). In particular, they study the effect of \(b\) on the shape of the graph. To observe how \(b\) affects the shape of the graph when \(b> 1\) and when \(0, they simultaneously examine several functions of this form, all of which have the same value of \(a\).
Narrow contexts are used in these lessons to encourage greater attention to the growth factors of the different functions, rather than on interpreting the quantities in context. Since students are focusing mainly on understanding how varying \(b\) affects the graph, they are looking at the structure of an exponential function and its graph (MP7).
One of the activities in this lesson works best when each student has access to devices that can run a Desmos applet because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way.

### Activity Title
Spending Gift Money
### Activity Narrative
"""
The goal of this Warm-up is to practice using an equation to model a situation characterized by exponential decay.
One strategy for choosing the right equation is to evaluate each equation for some value of \(t\). For instance, students may choose 1 for the value of \(t\), evaluate the expression, and see if the result makes sense for the amount of money after 1 week. Though this is a valid approach, encourage students to think about what is happening in the situation and to see if it is correctly reflected in the way each expression is written.
For instance, in Option A, the term \(\frac13 t\) in the expression would mean “a third of the time in weeks” (rather than a third of the gift money), suggesting that this expression doesn’t accurately reflect the situation. Similarly, in Option C, \( \frac13 \boldcdot 180^t\) would mean \(\frac13\) being multiplied by 180 repeatedly (\(t\) times), which also does not represent the situation.

### Student Task Statement
"""
Jada receives a gift of \$180. In the first week, she spends a third of the gift money. She continues spending a third of what is left each week thereafter. Which equation best represents the amount of gift money \(g\), in dollars, she has after \(t\) weeks? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.
\(g = 180 - \frac13 t\)
\(g = 180 \boldcdot \left(\frac13\right)^t\)
\(g = \frac13 \boldcdot 180^t\)
\(g = 180 \boldcdot \left(\frac23\right)^t\)
"""
### Building on Student Thinking
"""
Some students may choose Option B because of the words \(\frac{1}{3}\) of what is left in the prompt. Ask them what fraction of the quantity is left if \(\frac13\) of it is spent. If students are still not convinced, ask them how much of the 180 is spent in week 1? How much is left? Use your equation to verify that 120 is left.

### Activity Synthesis
Ask students for the correct response, and prompt them to explain why the other ones are not correct.
Make sure students understand that if a third of the balance is spent every week, two-thirds of the balance is what remains every week, so the value of \(b\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\), and the amount available after \(t\) weeks would be \(180 \boldcdot (\frac23)^t\).

Equations and Their Graphs
### Activity Narrative
"""
The goal of this lesson is to examine how the numbers \(a\) and \(b\) influence the graph representing a function, \(f\), defined by an equation of the form \(f(x) = a \boldcdot b^x\).
A money context is used in the first question to facilitate access. A bank account with more money is generally desirable, so students will be looking for the function that grows most quickly. The growth of the accounts is not realistic (unless more money is being added on a regular basis), and has been chosen to motivate a close analysis of the growth factors.
As students work and discuss in groups, notice those who can articulate how \(a\) and \(b\) in an exponential function affect a graph that represents it. Ask them to share later.

### Activity Synthesis
Invite previously selected students or groups to share their responses. Discuss:
“On the graph, where do you see the \(a\) of each function? How does the size of \(a\) affect the graph?” (The \(a\) is the \(y\)-intercept. The greater the \(a\), the higher it is on the vertical axis.)
“On the graph, where do you see the \(b\) of each function? How does the size of \(b\) affect the graph?” (The \(b\) appears in the steepness of the curve. When the function is characterized by exponential growth, the larger the \(b\), the steeper the curve, or the more quickly the quantity is growing.)
“How is the graph of \(j\) different from other graphs?” (It represents a situation characterized by exponential decay: \(j(x)\) decreases as \(x\) increases.)
“How is the \(b\) value for function \(j\) different from those of the other functions?” (The value of \(b\) is less than 1.)

Graphs Representing Exponential Decay
### Activity Narrative
"""
This activity complements the previous one. For a situation characterized by exponential growth, a larger base value, \(b\), means faster growth. For a situation characterized by exponential decay, however, a smaller value of \(b\) (between 0 and 1) corresponds to faster decay. Understanding how the parameter \(b\) influences the graph of an exponential function will prepare students to make sense of and model situations involving repeated percentage change later in the unit.

### Activity Synthesis
Focus the discussion on the connection between the numbers in the equation (especially the \(b\)) and the features of the graph. Discuss questions such as:
“In the first question, what does the point that the graphs share on the \(y\)-axis say about the situation?” (All of the accounts started with \$200.)
“How does Graph A compare to Graph D?” (Graph A appears more horizontal, so the function is decaying at a slower rate.)
“What does the largest factor (\(\frac78\)) tell us? To which graph does it correspond?” (The function loses only \(\frac18\) of its value when \(x\) increases by 1, so it is decaying the most slowly. Graph A must be the graph of \(q(x) = 200 \boldcdot \left(\frac78 \right)^x\) because it shows the slowest decay.)
“What might a graph representing a function \(v\), given by \(v(x) = 200 \boldcdot \left(\frac{99}{100}\right)^x\), look like?” (It would look very close to a horizontal line because nearly all of its value remains as \(x\) increases by 1, so it is decaying very slowly.)
“What might a graph representing a function \(w\), given by \(w(x) = 200 \boldcdot \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^x\), look like?” (It will go toward 0 extremely quickly because it loses \(\frac {99}{100}\) of its value each time \(x\) increases by 1, so it is decaying very quickly.)
Emphasize that, in situations characterized by exponential growth (when \(b>1\)), a larger value of \(b\) means a curve that is more vertical. In situations characterized by exponential decay, where \(b\) is between 0 and 1, the closer \(b\) is to 1, the more the graph approaches a horizontal line. Conversely, the smaller the value of \(b\), the more swiftly it heads toward 0 (the more vertical the curve is) before it flattens out and approaches a horizontal line.
# Lesson Close
## Lesson Synthesis
"""
In this lesson, we looked at how the parts of a function representing exponential change are expressed on the graph.
Display for all to see:
\(\displaystyle f(x)=a \boldcdot b^x\)
and display a blank set of coordinate axes focused on the first quadrant.
Ask three students to propose different positive numbers.
If \(b\) is 2, how would these three different numbers in place of \(a\) affect a graph representing this function? Sketch the graphs. Attend to how you would decide on a graphing window.
If \(b\) is \(\frac12\), what would the three graphs look like now? Sketch them.
If time permits, set a fixed value for \(a\), ask students to suggest three different positive numbers to use in place of \(b\), and repeat.

## Student Lesson Summary
"""
An exponential function can give us information about a graph that represents it.
For example, suppose that function \(q\) represents a bacteria population \(t\) hours after it is first measured, and \(q(t) = 5,\!000 \boldcdot (1.5)^t\). The number 5,000 is the bacteria population measured, when \(t\) is 0. The number 1.5 indicates that the bacteria population increases by a factor of 1.5 each hour.
A graph can help us see how the starting population (5,000) and growth factor (1.5) influence the population. Suppose functions \(p\) and \(r\) represent two other bacteria populations and are given by \(p(t) = 5,\!000 \boldcdot 2^t\) and  \(r(t) =5,\!000 \boldcdot (1.2)^t\). Here are the graphs of \(p\), \(q\), and \(r\).
Graph of 3 functions labeled, p, q, and r on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, time in hours, from 0 to 10, by 2's. Vertical axis, number of bacteria, from 0 to 40,000 by 20,000's. All three functions start at 0 comma 5,000 and trend upward and to the right. Function p passes through 2 comma 20,000 and trends rapidly upward and right. Function q passes through 4 comma11,250 and trends steadily upward and right. Function r passes through 6 comma 7,200 and trends more slowly upward and right.
Image description: <p>Graph of 3 functions on a grid. P, q, r.</p>
All three graphs start at \(5,\!000\), but the graph of \(r\) grows more slowly than does the graph of \(q\), while the graph of \(p\) grows more quickly. This makes sense because a population that doubles every hour is growing more quickly than one that increases by a factor of 1.5 each hour, and both grow more quickly than a population that increases by a factor of 1.2 each hour.
