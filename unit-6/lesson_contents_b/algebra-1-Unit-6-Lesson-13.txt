# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
This optional lesson provides additional practice investigating  the relationship between the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) in the expression \(a \boldcdot b^x\) and a graph representing the function \(f\) given by \(f(x) = a \boldcdot b^x\). Students start by identifying a function represented by a given graph and using the graph to make sense of a situation. They also examine two abstract graphs, with unlabeled axes, and decide which one represents a given situation. This level of abstraction is appropriate at this stage. It gives students an opportunity to apply what they have learned about the relationship between an exponential context and its graph, and to use graphs to better interpret the contexts. In both cases, they rely on their understanding of the connections between the parameters in an exponential expression and the features of an exponential graph (MP7) to answer questions.
"""
## Learning Goals
Interpret the intersection of the graphs of two functions that represent a situation.
Identify the initial value and growth factor of an exponential function given a graph showing two points with non-consecutive input values.
## Student-Facing Goal
Let’s investigate what we can learn from graphs that represent exponential functions.
## Student-Facing Targets
When I know two points on a graph of an exponential function, I can write an equation for the function.
I can explain the meaning of the intersection of the graphs of two functions in terms of the situations they represent.

### Activity Synthesis
Invite each group to share one reason why a particular set of three go together. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which three go together, attend to students’ explanations and ensure that the reasons given are correct.
During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as “exponential function,” “growth factor,” “initial amount,” and “linear.”

Value of a Computer
### Activity Narrative
"""
In a previous lesson, students used equations defining functions to reason about graphs. Here they work in the opposite direction, analyzing graphs and creating corresponding equations. In the first question, the coordinates given are not of two consecutive values of \(x\), so students need to reason about the decay factor indirectly. They may:
Try different factors that, when multiplied by \(f(0)\) twice, give \(f(2)\).
Use the graph to estimate \(f(1)\), and then use that estimate to find a reasonable decay factor.
Find the factor that takes \(f(0)\) to \(f(2)\) (or \(f(2)\) to \(f(4)\)), recognize that number as \(b^2\), and then find \(b\).
The second question has no context and is thus more abstract. This prepares students to interpret graphs in the next activity, where minimal information is given.

### Activity Synthesis
Select students to share their responses to the first question. Focus the discussion on how students found the decay factor for the computer. Make sure students understand that the key is to notice that every 2 years, the computer's value is multiplied by \(\frac{1}{4}\). This means that the annual decay factor is \(\frac{1}{2}\), because \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\).
For the last graph, discuss questions such as:
“What information is needed to describe an exponential function?” (the factor of growth or decay and the initial value)
“Where on the graph do we see the initial value?” (the \(y\)-intercept of the graph)
“What points on the graph can we use to help us find the growth factor?” (the points \((\text-1, 40)\) and \((0,20)\), or\((0,20)\) and \((2,5)\))
“Why might \((\text-1,40)\) and \((0,20)\) be a more strategic choice than \((0,20)\) and \((2,5)\) for finding the factor of growth?” (The \(x\) coordinates of first two points differ by 1, so the quotient of the \(y\) coordinates of those points can be used to find the factor of decay. It is a more direct way to find the factor of decay, which is the factor by which the output of \(f\) changes when the input, \(x\), changes by 1. In the second pair, the \(x\) coordinate changes by 2.)

Moldy Wall
### Activity Narrative
"""
This activity presents students with two graphs without numerical values assigned to any points on the graphs. The only labeled point is where the two graphs intersect. Students will need to use their understanding that tripling each day is a greater growth factor than doubling each day. This is their only means to decide which function represents which situation. Students then interpret the graphs in terms of the situations that they represent.
"""
### Launch
"""
Arrange students in groups of 2. Introduce the context of mold growing on a wall. Use Co-Craft Questions to orient students to the context and to elicit possible mathematical questions.
Display only the problem stem and related image, without revealing the questions. Give students 1–2 minutes to write a list of mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation, before they compare questions with a partner.
Invite several partners to share one question with the class, and record responses. Ask the class to make comparisons among the shared questions and their own. Ask, “What do these questions have in common? How are they different?” Listen for and amplify language related to the learning goal, such as “intersection,” “exponential growth,” and “growth factor.”
Reveal the questions and give students 1–2 minutes to compare them to their own questions and to those of their classmates. Invite students to identify similarities and differences by asking:	“Which of your questions is most similar to or different from the ones provided? Why?” “Is there a main mathematical concept that is present in both your questions and those provided? If so, describe it.”

When the mold was first spotted and measured, was there more of Mold A or Mold B? Explain how you know.
What does the point \((p, q)\) tell us in this situation?

Some students may think that the dashed graph represents the mold that is tripling because it has a greater vertical intercept. Ask these students to think carefully about the second question.

"""
### Activity Synthesis
Select students to share their responses and explanations. Focus on how they deciphered the meanings of the graphs. Discuss questions such as:
The solid graph started off lower than the dashed graph. What does that mean in this context? (The mold population represented by the solid graph is initially smaller or covers a smaller area on the wall than the one represented by the dashed graph.)
After some point, the solid graph passes the dashed one. What does that mean in this context? (The mold population that started out covering a greater area on the wall is surpassed by the other population, so it is growing at a slower rate.)
What does the intersection of the two graphs mean? What do \(p\) and \(q\) represent? (The two mold populations are the same at time \(p\) with population covering an area of \(q\) square inches.)

In this lesson, we interpreted graphs and reasoned about their equations. Show the graph of \(y =f(x)\) for an exponential function \(f\) with some points labeled.

Tell students that the  \(x\)-coordinate of \(Q\) is 1 and the \(x\)-coordinate of \(R\) is 2. Ask students what information would give us insight into the situation and help us write an equation corresponding to the graph.
“What do you need to know in order to describe how the function is decreasing?” (coordinates of two of the labeled points)
“If you could find out the coordinates of two of these points, which two would you choose? Why?” (\(P\) and \(Q\), or \(Q\) and \(R\), because the quotient of their \(y\)-coordinates gives the growth factor.)
“How would you find the equation using these two coordinates?” (use the \(y\)-coordinate of \(P\) and the growth factor)
Consider showing the graph of \(y=f(x)\) along with the graph of \(y=g(x)\) for another exponential function \(g\).

Ask students to compare the two functions:
“Which function is decreasing faster? How do you know?” (\(g\) because it has a larger \(y\)-intercept than \(f\) but then takes smaller values than \(f\) as \(x\) grows)
(If the graphs cross) “What does the intersection of the two graphs mean?” (The outputs of \(f\) and \(g\) are the same for this value of \(x\).)
"""
## Student Lesson Summary
"""
If we have enough information about a graph representing an exponential function \(f\), we can write a corresponding equation. Here is a graph of \(y = f(x)\).
An equation defining an exponential function has the form \(f(x) = a \boldcdot b^x\). The value of \(a\) is the starting value or \(f(0)\), so it is the \(y\)-intercept of the graph. We can see that \(f(0)\) is 500 and that the function is decreasing.
Graph of a function on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, x, from 0 to 4, by 2's. Vertical axis, y. from 0 to 600, by 200's. Plotted points as follows: 0 comma 500, 1 comma 300. Line is drawn through the points, moving downward and to the right.
Image description: <p>Graph of a function on grid.</p>
The value of \(b\) is the growth factor. It is the number by which we multiply the function’s output at \(x\) to get the output at \(x+1\). To find this growth factor for \(f\), we can calculate \(\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}\), which is \(\frac{300}{500}\) (or \(\frac35\)). So an equation that defines \(f\) is:
\(\displaystyle f(x) = 500 \boldcdot \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^x\)
We can also use graphs to compare functions. Here are graphs representing two different exponential functions, labeled \(g\) and \(h\). Each one represents the area of algae (in square meters) in a pond, \(x\) days after certain fish were introduced.
Pond A had 40 square meters of algae. Its area shrinks to \(\frac{8}{10}\) of the area on the previous day.
Pond B had 50 square meters of algae. Its area shrinks to \(\frac 25\) of the area on the previous day.
Graph of 2 functions on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, x, Vertical axis, y. Function h, blue line, starts on the vertical axis,  moves downward and to the right, almost linearly.. Function g, green line, starts above function h, moves downward and to the right, exponentially.
Image description: <p>Graph of 2 functions on a grid.</p>
Can you tell which graph corresponds to which algae population?
We can see that the \(y\)-intercept of \(g\)'s graph is greater than the \(y\)-intercept of \(h\)'s graph. We can also see that \(g\) has a smaller growth factor than \(h\) because as \(x\) increases by the same amount, \(g\) is retaining a smaller fraction of its value compared to \(h\). This suggests that \(g\) corresponds to Pond B, and \(h\) corresponds to Pond A.
