## Activity 0: Which Three Go Together: Tables of Values





----------------------------------------

### Activity 0 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to analyze and compare tables of values to determine which three tables are related. They practiced using precise language and terminology to justify their choices. The challenge was to explain their reasoning clearly, as there was no single correct answer, encouraging discussion and deeper understanding of concepts like "common differences" and "common factors."

Activity 0 Title: Which Three Go Together: Tables of Values

Activity 0 Timing: 5 mins

Activity 0 Narrative: This Warm-up prompts students to compare four tables. It gives students a reason to use language precisely (MP6). It gives the teacher an opportunity to hear how students use terminology and talk about characteristics of the items in comparison to one another.

Activity 0 Launch: 

Activity 0 Task Statement: Which three go together? Why do they go together?
Table A
\(x\) | \(y\)
1 | 8
2 | 16
3 | 24
4 | 32
8 | 64
Table B
\(x\) | \(y\)
0 | 0
2 | 16
4 | 32
6 | 48
8 | 64
Table C

4 | 256
Table D

0 | 4
1 | 8
2 | 12
3 | 16
4 | 20

Activity 0 Synthesis: Invite each group to share one reason why a particular set of three go together. Record and display the responses for all to see. After each response, ask the class if they agree or disagree. Since there is no single correct answer to the question of which three go together, attend to students’ explanations and ensure that the reasons given are correct.
During the discussion, ask students to explain the meaning of any terminology they use, such as “common differences” or “common factors.”

## Activity 1: Growing Stores





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to compare linear and exponential growth through tables. They observed that linear functions grow by equal differences each year (Plan A) while exponential functions grow by equal factors (Plan B). This highlights that doubling the number of stores increases growth significantly compared to adding a fixed amount. Students practiced calculating differences and factors, reinforcing their understanding of these growth patterns.

Activity 1 Title: Growing Stores

Activity 1 Timing: 20 mins

Activity 1 Narrative: In this activity, students use tables to make comparisons between 2 patterns. A table is particularly helpful for illustrating that:
Linear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals
Exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals
At this stage, students simply observe these properties for a few particular functions and in the context of concrete problems. Toward the end of the unit, they will prove that these properties are true for any linear or exponential function.

Activity 1 Launch: Display the table for all to see. It shows the number of coffee shops worldwide that a company had in its first 10 years. Ask, "What do you notice? What do you wonder?"
Ask students to share the things that they noticed and wondered about.
Students may notice:
The number of stores nearly doubled between 1987 and 1988.
The number continued to grow by more than 1.5 times per year (except from 1990 to 1991 and from 1991 to 1992).
They added close to 1,000 stores in 10 years.
Students may wonder:
How many stores do they have now? (22,519 in 2015, more than 24,000 in 2017)
Have the stores increased by roughly the same number since 1996?
How do you find the differences and factors from previous years?
year | number of stores | difference from previous year | factor from previous year
1987 | 17 | - | -
1988 | 33 |  | 
1989 | 55 |  | 
1990 | 84 |  | 
1991 | 116 |  | 
1992 | 165 |  | 
1993 | 272 |  | 
1994 | 425 |  | 
1995 | 677 |  | 
1996 | 1,015 |  | 
... |  |  | 
2015 |  |  | 
Ask students how they might calculate values for the last 2 columns. (For the difference, subtract the number of stores in the row from the number of stores in the row above it. For example, in the 1988 row, the difference is 16 because \(33 - 17 = 16\). For the factor, divide the number of stores in the row by the number of stores in the row above it. For example, in the 1988 row, the factor is about 1.94 because \(\frac{33}{17} \approx 1.94\).)
Give students access to a spreadsheet tool or a calculator. It is ideal if each student has their own device. Arrange students in groups of 2. If time is limited, ask one partner to complete the questions for Plan A and the other to do so for Plan B.

Activity 1 Synthesis: To help students compare and contrast the two tables, ask:
“How are the tables alike? Or how was the process of completing the two tables the same?” (The tables both follow a simple pattern: Each table row is calculated by applying the same single arithmetic operation to the previous row. This pattern also holds for every other row or every third row, and so on. The entries in both tables increase as we go down the table.)
“How are the tables different? Or how was the process of completing the two tables different?” (In Plan A, 20 new stores are added each year; the repeated arithmetic operation is addition. In Plan B, the number of stores is doubled each year; the repeated arithmetic operation is multiplication. Plan B grows much more quickly than does Plan A.)
Students may notice in the table that the difference from the number of stores the previous year is the same as the number of stores the previous year. This is because of the doubling pattern: to find the number of stores in the next year, the number from the previous year is added to itself (or doubled).

## Activity 2: Flow and Followers





----------------------------------------

### Activity 2 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to identify different growth patterns by analyzing two scenarios with identical numbers. They discovered that one situation involved exponential growth (tripling followers) and the other represented linear growth (adding water at a constant rate). By comparing expressions and tables, they realized that multiplication indicated rapid growth, while addition showed slow, steady growth.
