Activity 0 Title: Math Talk: Exponent Rules

Activity 0 Timing: 10 mins

Activity 0 Narrative: This Math Talk focuses on properties of exponents. It encourages students to think about how to multiply and divide numbers in exponential notation when the bases are the same and to rely on the structure of the notation to mentally solve problems. The understanding elicited here will be helpful later in the lesson when students work with exponential growth.

Activity 0 Launch: Before starting the math talk, it may be helpful to take time to ensure that students understand the question. Ask students for examples and non-examples of a power of 2. Some examples are \(2^5\) and \(2^{100}\). Non-examples include \(100^2\) and \(5\boldcdot 2\). It may be useful to further remind students that, for example, \(2^5\) equals \(2 \boldcdot2 \boldcdot2 \boldcdot2 \boldcdot2\).
Tell students to close their books or devices (or to keep them closed). Reveal one problem at a time. For each problem:
Give students quiet think time, and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy.
Invite students to share their strategies, and record and display their responses for all to see.
Use the questions in the Activity Synthesis to involve more students in the conversation before moving to the next problem.
Keep all previous problems and work displayed throughout the talk.

Activity 0 Task Statement: Rewrite each expression as a power of 2.
\(2^3 \boldcdot 2^4\)
\(2^5 \boldcdot 2\)
\(2^{10} \div 2^7\)
\(2^9 \div 2\)

Activity 0 Synthesis: To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:
“Who can restate \(\underline{\hspace{.5in}}\)’s reasoning in a different way?”
“Did anyone use the same strategy but would explain it differently?”
“Did anyone solve the problem in a different way?”
“Does anyone want to add on to \(\underline{\hspace{.5in}}\)’s strategy?”
“Do you agree or disagree? Why?”
“What connections to previous problems do you see?”
Remind students that exponents can be added when multiplying exponential expressions with the same base and subtracted when dividing those with the same base.

## Activity 1: What Does $x^0$ Mean?





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned that any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one (e.g., \\(5^0 = 1\\)). This convention helps maintain the exponent rule \\(b^x \\cdot b^y = b^{x+y}\\) even when one of the exponents is zero.

Activity 1 Title: What Does $x^0$ Mean?

Activity 1 Timing: 10 mins

Activity 1 Narrative: This task reviews an important property of exponents, which students have studied in grade 8, namely that if \(b\) is a non-zero number, then \(b^0 = 1\). This is a convention, one that allows the rule \(b^x \boldcdot b^y = b^{x+y}\) to remain true when \(x\) or \(y\) is allowed to be 0. An additional convention, which is not addressed in this task, states that \(b^{\text-n} = \frac{1}{b^n}\) for a whole number \(n\). With these conventions, the equation \(b^x \boldcdot b^y = b^{x+y}\) is true for all integers \(x\) and \(y\).

What is the value of \(5^0\)? What about \(2^0\)?

Activity 1 Synthesis: Make sure students understand that \(5^0 = 1\) is an agreed-upon definition. The reason for defining \(5^0\) this way is so that the property (\(5^a \boldcdot 5^b = 5^{a+b}\)) continues to hold when we allow 0 as an exponent.

## Activity 2: Multiplying Microbes





----------------------------------------

### Activity 2 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

**Key Insight:** Students learned how to express the exponential growth of bacteria using the equation \\(n = 500 \\cdot 2^t\\). They discovered that 500 represents the initial population and 2 is the growth factor, indicating the population doubles each hour. They also generalized this pattern to represent other situations, like parasites growing at a rate of 3 times their population.

----------------------------------------

Activity 2 Title: Multiplying Microbes

Activity 2 Timing: 15 mins

Activity 2 Narrative: This activity prompts students to build expressions of the form \(a \boldcdot b^x\) to encapsulate a type of pattern they have encountered several times so far, and to consider what \(a\) and \(b\) mean in the context of bacteria growth. They do so by writing numerical expressions that make explicit the key feature of exponential change, the repeated multiplication by the same factor, and then making a generalization of their repeated reasoning (MP8) using exponential notation. Since students are finally representing this pattern using an exponent, a quantity following this type of pattern is described as changing exponentially. The term growth factor is given to the multiplier or \(b\) in an expression of the form \(a \boldcdot b^x\).

Activity 2 Launch: Display the problem stem from the first question for all to see. Ask students what happens to the population of the bacteria when they split. (The number of bacteria doubles.) If necessary, draw a picture of 2 bacteria labeled “at hour 0” and 4 bacteria labeled “hour 1” to represent the population growth.
Clarify that it is not necessary to compute the number of bacteria at the end of each hour. Students may write an expression. If needed, provide an example (for example, the expression for the first day could be \(500 \boldcdot 2\) rather than 1000).
Use Collect and Display to create a shared reference that captures students’ developing mathematical language. Collect the language that students use to describe the population growth. Display words and phrases such as “multiplier,” “exponentially,” and “doubling.”

Activity 2 Task Statement: In a biology lab, 500 bacteria reproduce by splitting. Every hour, on the hour, each bacterium splits into two bacteria.Write an expression to show how to find the number of bacteria after each hour listed in the table.Write an equation relating \(n\), the number of bacteria, to \(t\), the number of hours.Use your equation to find \(n\) when \(t\) is 0.

In a biology lab, 500 bacteria reproduce by splitting. Every hour, on the hour, each bacterium splits into two bacteria.
Write an expression to show how to find the number of bacteria after each hour listed in the table.
Write an equation relating \(n\), the number of bacteria, to \(t\), the number of hours.
Use your equation to find \(n\) when \(t\) is 0. What does this value of \(n\) mean in this situation?
When the values of one variable are multiplied by the same value each time the other variable increases by 1, that multiplier is called the growth factor. What is the growth factor in this situation?
hour | number of bacteria
0 | 500
1 | 
2 | 
3 | 
6 | 
t | 
In a different biology lab, a population of single-cell parasites also reproduces hourly. An equation that gives the number of parasites, \(p\), after \(t\) hours is \(p = 100 \boldcdot 3^t.\) Explain what the numbers 100 and 3 mean in this situation.

Activity 2 Synthesis: Direct students’ attention to the reference created using Collect and Display. Ask students to share how they found the first expression. Invite students to borrow language from the display as needed and update the reference to include additional phrases as they respond.
Invite students to share the expressions in their table and their generalized expression for the number of bacteria after \(t\) hours. Make connections between, for example, \(500 \boldcdot 2 \boldcdot 2 \boldcdot 2 \boldcdot 2 \boldcdot 2\), the more concise expression \(500 \boldcdot 2^5\), and the more general expression representing any number of hours \(500 \boldcdot 2^t\). Highlight that 500 is not only the initial number of bacteria, but the result of evaluating \(500 \boldcdot 2^0\).
Tell students that in patterns like these, where a quantity is repeatedly multiplied by the same factor, the quantity is often described as changing exponentially. We can see why: An exponent is used to express the relationship.
Questions for discussion:
“Is the growth of the bacteria characterized by common differences or common factors? How do you know?” (Common factors, since each time that the hour increases by 1, the number of bacteria is multiplied by the same factor.)
“In each row in the table, what does the value of 500 mean? Why doesn't it change?” (It is the initial bacteria population when they are first measured.)
“What does \(2^0\) mean in this situation?” (\(2^0\) tells us no doubling has happened, so the original population of 500 is all we have.)
“What do the 100 and 3 mean in the expression \(100 \boldcdot 3^t\)?” (100 is the initial population of the parasites when they are first measured, and the number 3 is the growth factor—the number by which the population is multiplied each hour.)
“If the starting parasite population is 80 but the population quadruples every hour, how will the expression change?” (It will be \(80 \boldcdot 4^t\).)

## Activity 3: Graphing the Microbes





----------------------------------------

### Activity 3 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned that the vertical intercept of a graph represents the initial bacteria population size when \\(t = 0\\). They also realized that the growth factor, shown by the rate the graph rises, indicates how quickly the bacteria population grows.



----------------------------------------

Activity 3 Title: Graphing the Microbes

Activity 3 Timing: 10 mins

Activity 3 Narrative: Having just seen an example of the meaning of \(a\) and \(b\) in an exponential expression \(a \boldcdot b^x\), students now focus on interpreting these numbers using graphs. They graph the equations from the previous task, noticing that \(a\) is the vertical intercept of the graph, while the number \(b\) determines how quickly the graph grows (since in these cases \(b>1\)). A larger value of \(b\) corresponds to a more rapid rate of growth for the bacteria population. The axes for the graphs have been labeled here, but in future activities, students will have to think strategically about how to label the axes to most effectively plot the points.
Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).

Activity 3 Launch: Display the equations \(n = 500 \boldcdot 2^t\) and \(p = 100 \boldcdot 3^t\) from the previous activity for all to see.

Activity 3 Task Statement: Refer back to your work in the table of the previous task. Use that information and the given coordinate planes to graph the following:a. Graph \((t,n)\) when \(t\) is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. 	 b. Graph \((t,p)\) when \(t\) is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. (If you get stuck, you can create a table.)
Refer back to your work in the table of the previous task. Use that information and the given coordinate planes to graph the following:
a. Graph \((t,n)\) when \(t\) is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Image description: <p>Blank coordinate plane, origin O, with grid. Horizontal axis, labeled t, from 0 to 4, by 1’s. Vertical axis, labeled n, from 0 to 9,000, by 1,000’s.</p>
b. Graph \((t,p)\) when \(t\) is 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. (If you get stuck, you can create a table.)
Image description: <p>Blank coordinate plane, origin O, with grid. Horizontal axis, labeled t, from 0 to 4, by 1’s. Vertical axis, labeled p, from 0 to 9,000, by 1,000’s.</p>
On the graph of \(n\), where can you see each number that appears in the equation?
On the graph of \(p\), where can you see each number that appears in the equation?

Activity 3 Synthesis: Make sure that students recognize two key takeaways from this activity:
The vertical intercept of the graph is the initial bacteria population size. It is the size of the population when first measured, or when \(t\), the number of hours since measurement, is 0.
The growth factor of the populations is represented by how quickly the graph increases.

Emphasize that \\(a\\) is the vertical intercept, which indicates the starting population size at \\(t = 0\\).<br>6. Highlight that \\(b\\) affects the growth rate; a higher \\(b\\) means faster growth.<br>7. Watch for common misunderstandings, particularly confusing the axes or misreading values from the previous task.
