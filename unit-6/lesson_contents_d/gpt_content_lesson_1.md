## Activity 1: A Magical Offer





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned how two different growth patterns—linear and exponential—affect the value of money over time. They discovered that even small starting values can lead to very large amounts through doubling, while a constant daily increase results in a much smaller total. They practiced calculations, discussed how to represent these patterns with equations, and reflected on the importance of precise language in both math and storytelling. Ultimately, they decided which purse to choose based on their calculated values.

Activity 1 Title: A Magical Offer

Activity 1 Timing: 15 mins

Activity 1 Narrative: The goal of this activity is to allow students to explore two growth patterns and to notice that a doubling pattern eventually grows very, very large even with a small starting value. Students may perform a repeated calculation, or they may generalize the process by writing expressions or equations.
Making spreadsheet technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).

Activity 1 Launch: Provide access to calculators or spreadsheets for every student.
Ask students what stories they may know about a person encountering a wish giver. This situation uses a magical fish, which has historical roots in many cultures including Chinese folklore (Ye Xian (YEE SHEE-ahn)), ancient English fables (The Fish and the Ring), and Haitian fairy tales (Tenzin the Fish).
In many traditions, wish givers are also tricksters that will try to corrupt a wish. Emphasize that being precise in language and explanation is helpful not only in the phrasing of a wish, but also in math class for communication.
Present the situation (either by asking students to read it quietly, or by performing a dramatic reading).
Ask students, “How much money will be in each purse after a week?” (After 7 days, Purse A will contain \$2,400 because it grows by \$200 each day for 7 days. Purse B will contain \$1.28. It doubles each day for 7 days, so it will have \(1 \boldcdot 2^7\), or 128 cents (the 1 here represents the 1 cent in the purse when the purses are offered).) If no students mention using multiplication for repeated addition or an exponent for repeated multiplication, ask how they might use the number 7 to find the worth of each purse. Tell students to enter the amounts into the table in their Task Statement.
In addition to orienting students to the calculations, use this opportunity to point out that the convention here is that the days are numbered the same as the number of times additional money is added. For example, when the purses are initially offered, it is day 0. After the \$200 is added or the money is doubled once, it is day 1. Day 2 is when the money has been added twice.
After the 1st read, say, “Tell your partner what this situation is about.”
After the 2nd read, say, “List the quantities. What can be counted or measured?”
For the 3rd read, reveal and read the table. Ask, “What are some ways we might get started on this?”

Activity 1 Task Statement: While walking along a beach, you notice a fish trapped in a small pool. You release the fish into the ocean, but before it swims away, it turns to reward you for your good deed.
It tells you, "Thank you for freeing me from that tide pool! I was getting claustrophobic. You can choose one of these purses as a reward. You cannot add money to the purses, and once you take any money out, the magic is broken and no more money will be added, but you may keep what is inside."
Purse A contains \$1,000 today. If you leave it alone, it will contain \$1,200 tomorrow (by magic). The next day, it will contain \$1,400. This pattern of \$200 additional dollars per day will continue.
Purse B contains 1 penny today. Leave that penny in there, because tomorrow it will (magically) turn into 2 pennies. The next day, there will be 4 pennies. The amount in the purse will continue to double each day.
time passed | 0 days | 1 day | 2 days | 7 days(1 week) | 14 days(2 weeks) | 21 days(3 weeks) | 30 days(1 month) | Purse A | Purse B
\$1,000 | \$1,200 | \$1,400 |  |  |  | 
\$0.01 | \$0.02 | \$0.04 |  |  |  | 
7 days			(1 week)
Complete the table for the amount of money in each purse for the given number of days after the fish offers the purses. Be prepared to explain your reasoning for each value.

Activity 1 Synthesis: Focus the discussion on how students found the amounts of money in the two purses after many days. Invite students who performed recursive calculations and those who wrote expressions or equations to share their reasoning. Record and display students' reasoning for all to see. Seeing the repeated reasoning will support students' generalization work later. For example, the amount in Purse A will be \(1,\!000 + 200\) for day 1, then \(1,\!000 + 200 + 200\) for day 2, \(1,\!000 + 200 + 200 + 200\) for day 3, and so on. Connect this to writing expressions like \(1,000+200 \boldcdot 3\) and \(1,000+200x\) where \(x\) represents the number of days since the fish offered the purses.
For Purse B, highlight the fact that after two days it contains \((1 \boldcdot 2) \boldcdot 2\) cents, which is \(2^2\) cents. After three days it contains \((1 \boldcdot 2 )\boldcdot 2 \boldcdot 2\) cents, which is \(2^3\) cents. This is a good opportunity to emphasize the meaning of exponential notation. Exponential notation is particularly useful for expressing the amount in Purse B on day 30, which is \(2^{30}\) cents.
Conclude the activity by polling the class about which purse they would choose.
If no students use a spreadsheet, consider demonstrating how it might be helpful in performing calculations like these.

## Activity 2: Graphing the Fish's Offers





----------------------------------------

### Activity 2 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to compare linear and exponential growth using graphs. They visualized how money in Purse A increases steadily (linear) while Purse B doubles each day (exponential). They realized that graphs help clarify when Purse B becomes a better choice, illustrating the differences in growth patterns more clearly than numbers alone. This understanding improved their ability to analyze and decide between the two offers.

**Activity 2 Title:** Graphing the Fish's Offers<br><br>**Activity 2 Timing:** 15 mins<br><br>**Revised Activity Narrative:**  <br>In this activity, students will visually compare two types of growth: linear and exponential. They will learn that linear growth adds a constant amount, forming a straight line, while exponential growth multiplies by a constant factor, forming a curve. This focus will help students grasp these concepts without getting overwhelmed by details.<br><br>---<br><br>**Revised Launch:**  <br>Say to students: “Today, we’ll look at two ways money can grow in a purse: one that grows steadily and one that grows quickly. We want to see what these look like on a graph. Does anyone remember what the vertical intercept means?” (If necessary, briefly explain vertical intercept.)<br><br>---<br><br>**Revised Student Task Statement:**  <br>Here are two graphs showing how money changes in Purse A and Purse B.  <br>- Purse A starts with $1,000 and increases by $200 each day.  <br>- Purse B starts with $0.01 and doubles every day.  <br>- Identify which graph represents Purse A and which represents Purse B.  <br>- Point P: (9, 5.12) and Point Q: (5, 2000) are marked.  <br><br>**Image description:** <p>Graph of an exponential function, origin O. Number of days and amount in dollars.</p>  <br><br>1. Which graph is for Purse A? Which is for Purse B? Explain your choice.  <br>2. What do Point P and Point Q represent?  <br>3. What are the vertical intercept coordinates for each graph?  <br>4. When does Purse B become better than Purse A?  <br>5. Based on the graphs, which purse would you pick? Why?<br><br>---<br><br>**Revised Activity Synthesis:**  <br>Hold a discussion by asking, “How did the graphs help you understand the growth of each purse? Did they provide a clearer view?” Encourage students to share their thoughts. Highlight how graphs illustrate growth patterns, showing that visuals often make comparisons easier than just numbers.<br><br>Additionally, revise personal conclusions about which purse to choose using the “Stronger and Clearer Each Time” method. Here are some questions to prompt peer feedback:  <br>- “What do you mean by that?”  <br>- “Can you say it differently?”  <br>- “How do you know that?”  <br><br>End with a review where students compare their first drafts with revised ones, and select a few to share their improvements.
