    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students analyze the graph\u00a0of an exponential function\u00a0\\(f\\)\u00a0given by\u00a0\\(f(x) = a \\boldcdot b^x\\). In particular, they study the effect of \\(b\\) on the shape of the graph. To observe how \\(b\\) affects the shape of the graph when \\(b> 1\\) and when \\(0, they simultaneously examine several functions of this form, all of which have the same value of \\(a\\).\nNarrow contexts are used in these lessons to encourage greater attention to\u00a0the growth factors of the different functions, rather than on interpreting the quantities in context. Since students are focusing mainly on understanding how varying\u00a0\\(b\\) affects the graph, they are looking at the structure of an exponential function and its graph (MP7).\nOne of the activities in this lesson works\u00a0best when each student has access to devices that can run a Desmos applet because students will benefit from seeing the relationship in a dynamic way.",

        "Activity Narrative": "The goal of this Warm-up is to practice using an equation to model a situation characterized by exponential decay.\nOne strategy for choosing the right equation is to evaluate each equation for\u00a0some value of \\(t\\). For instance, students may choose 1 for the value of \\(t\\), evaluate the expression, and see if the result makes sense for the amount of money after 1 week. Though this is a valid approach, encourage students to think about what is happening in the situation and to see if it is correctly reflected in the way each expression is written.\nFor instance, in Option A, the term \\(\\frac13 t\\) in the expression would mean \u201ca third of the time in weeks\u201d (rather than a third of the gift money), suggesting that this expression doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the situation. Similarly, in Option C, \\( \\frac13 \\boldcdot 180^t\\) would mean \\(\\frac13\\) being multiplied by 180 repeatedly (\\(t\\) times), which also does not represent the situation.",

        "Student Task Statement": "Jada receives a gift of \\$180. In the first week, she spends a third of the gift money. She continues spending a third of what is left each week thereafter. Which equation best represents the amount of gift money \\(g\\), in dollars, she has after \\(t\\) weeks? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.\n\\(g = 180 - \\frac13 t\\)\n\\(g = 180 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac13\\right)^t\\)\n\\(g = \\frac13 \\boldcdot 180^t\\)\n\\(g = 180 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac23\\right)^t\\)",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students may choose Option B because of the words \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of what is left in the prompt. Ask them what fraction of the quantity is left if \\(\\frac13\\) of it is spent. If students are still not convinced, ask them how much of the 180 is spent in week 1? How much is left? Use your equation to verify that 120 is left.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Ask students for the correct response, and prompt them to explain why the other ones are not correct.\nMake sure students understand that if a third of the balance is spent every week, two-thirds of the balance is what remains every week, so the value of \\(b\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), and the amount available after \\(t\\) weeks would be \\(180 \\boldcdot (\\frac23)^t\\)."

    "Student Lesson Summary": "An exponential function can give us information about a graph that represents it.\nFor example, suppose that\u00a0function\u00a0\\(q\\)\u00a0represents a bacteria population\u00a0\\(t\\) hours after it is first measured, and\u00a0\\(q(t) = 5,\\!000 \\boldcdot (1.5)^t\\). The number 5,000 is the bacteria population measured, when \\(t\\) is 0. The number 1.5 indicates that the bacteria population increases by a factor of 1.5 each hour.\nA graph can help us see how the starting population (5,000) and growth factor (1.5) influence the population. Suppose functions \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) represent two other\u00a0bacteria populations and are given by\u00a0\\(p(t) = 5,\\!000 \\boldcdot 2^t\\) and\u00a0\u00a0\\(r(t) =5,\\!000 \\boldcdot (1.2)^t\\). Here are the graphs of \\(p\\), \\(q\\), and \\(r\\).\nGraph of 3 functions labeled, p, q, and r on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, time in hours, from 0 to 10, by 2's. Vertical axis, number of bacteria, from 0 to 40,000 by 20,000's. All three functions start at 0 comma 5,000 and trend upward and to the right. Function p passes through 2 comma 20,000 and trends rapidly\u00a0upward and right. Function q passes through 4 comma11,250 and trends steadily upward and right. Function r passes through 6 comma 7,200 and trends more slowly upward and right.\nImage description: <p>Graph of 3 functions on a grid. P, q, r.</p>\nAll three graphs start at \\(5,\\!000\\), but the graph of\u00a0\\(r\\) grows more slowly than does the graph of \\(q\\), while the graph of \\(p\\) grows more quickly. This makes sense because a population that doubles every hour is growing more quickly than one that increases by a factor of 1.5 each hour, and both grow more quickly than a population that increases by a factor of 1.2 each hour."
