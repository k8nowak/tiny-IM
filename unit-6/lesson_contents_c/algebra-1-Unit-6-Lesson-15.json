    "Lesson Narrative": "This is the first of several lessons that develop students' ability to use exponential expressions (and eventually functions) to model repeated interest calculations. Students graph the associated exponential functions for different interest rates. Though the term compounding is not yet used with students, the activities help students see that, in the context of borrowing money, high interest rates and compounding do not favor the borrower. In later lessons, students will learn that the same mechanisms can be favorable in the context of saving money.\nTo represent compounded interest with an exponential expression or an exponential function, students need to realize that the process of repeatedly applying, say, 5% interest \\(n\\) times, is the same as multiplying by \\((1.05)^n\\). This is an example of looking for and expressing regularity in repeated reasoning (MP8).",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students see a situation in which a percent change is applied twice, first on the initial amount, and then on the amount that results from the first percent change. The multiplicative way of expressing the change is particularly helpful in such a situation. The example uses a familiar context of sales and discounts. The repeated decay results from applying a factor that is less than 1 more than once.",

        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Students may have chosen to calculate the price after each discount separately. For instance, they may have found the cost after the first discount to be \\$24 (because \\(32 \\boldcdot (0.75)=24\\), or \\(32 - (0.25) \\boldcdot 32=24\\)), and then calculated \\(24 \\boldcdot (0.75)\\), or \\(24 - (0.25) \\boldcdot 24\\). To help them see the repeated multiplication by a factor, consider recording their steps without evaluating any step.\nFocus the discussion on different expressions that can be used to efficiently calculate the final cost of the book, for instance:\n\\(32 \\boldcdot (0.75) \\boldcdot (0.75)\\)\n\\((0.75) \\boldcdot (0.75) \\boldcdot 32\\)\n\\(\\frac{3}{4} \\boldcdot \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\boldcdot 32\\right)\\)"

        "Activity Title": "Owing Interests",
        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students use exponential expressions to describe and make sense of repeated percent increase in a borrowing context. An essential point here is that, in each repetition, the value being increased by a percent is not the same as the initial value. Instead, it includes previous increases.\nTo express this repetition more generally, it is important for students\u00a0to represent the percent increase using multiplication. For example, if a baseball card is valued at \\$15 and increases in value by 10% each year, there are many ways to write the value of the card, in dollars, after one year including:\n\\(16.50\\)\n\\(15 + 1.50\\)\n\\(15 + (0.1) \\boldcdot 15\\)\n\\(15 \\boldcdot (1+0.1)\\)\n\\(15 \\boldcdot (1.1)\\)\nThe first three expressions are not particularly helpful for finding the value after 2 years or 3 years. The last two expressions, however, can be applied any number of times, giving the value, after \\(t\\) years:\n\\(15 \\boldcdot (1+0.1)^t\\)\n\\(15 \\boldcdot (1.1)^t\\)\nLook for students who write expressions using multiplication, and invite them to share during the discussion. Note that the expression \\(15 \\boldcdot(1+0.1)^t\\) is a very important way to express a 10 percent increase, even though it involves addition, because it calls attention to the percent increase. It is sometimes generalized to formulas such as \\(P \\boldcdot (1+\\frac{r}{n})^{nt}\\), although that formula is not presented in these materials. If any students write 1.18 as \\((1 + 0.18)\\) in this task, make sure to invite them to share during the discussion.",
        "Launch": "Ask students what they know about how loans work. If students are unfamiliar with the idea of interest on loans, give a brief overview. Explain that a person or a bank may lend money to someone who needs it. In return, the lender would collect interest, which is a percentage of the loan, until the loan is paid. For instance, if Person A decides to borrow \\$400 from a lender at a 10% interest rate calculated yearly, then after one year Person A will need to pay the lender \\(400 \\boldcdot (0.1)\\) or \\$40 in interest, in addition to returning the borrowed amount.\nArrange students in groups of 2. After the second question, discuss:\nHow did you calculate the amounts in year 1, 2, and 3?\u00a0(I found the amount owed after 1 year, then applied the interest to that value for the amount owed in year 2, then again for year 3.)\nCould you have found the amount in year 2 without calculating year 1? Could you have found the amount in year 3 without year 2?\u00a0(Yes, applying a growth factor of \\((1+0.18)\\) or 1.18 multiple times would result in the same solution.)\nAfter the 1st read, say,\u00a0\u201cTell your partner what this situation is about.\u201d\nAfter the 2nd read, say,\u00a0\u201cList the quantities. What can be counted or measured?\u201d\nFor the 3rd read,\u00a0reveal and read the questions. Ask, \u201cWhat are some ways we might get started on this?\u201d",
        "Student Task Statement": "To get a new computer, a recent college graduate obtains a loan of \\$450. She agrees to pay 18% annual interest, which will apply to any money she owes. She makes no payments during the first year.\nHow much will she owe at the end of one year? Show your reasoning.\nAssuming she continues to make no payments to the lender, how much will she owe at the end of two years? Three years?\nTo find the amount owed at the end of the third year, a student started by writing: \\(\\displaystyle \\text{[Year 3 Amount]}=\\text{[Year 2 Amount]} + \\text{[Year 2 Amount]} \\boldcdot (0.18)\\) and ended with \\(\\displaystyle \\text{[Year 3 Amount]} = 450\\boldcdot (1.18)\\boldcdot(1.18)\\boldcdot(1.18)\\). Does her final expression correctly reflect the amount owed at the end of the third year? Explain or show your reasoning.\nWrite an expression for the amount she owes at the end of \\(x\\) years without payment.",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students may have trouble finding the general expression for the amount owed after \\(x\\) years. Suggest that they work with expressions that use the original \\$450 for each year of the loan until a pattern becomes apparent.",

Make a new shape by taking the middle third of the line segment and replacing it by two line segments of the same length to reconnect the two pieces.

        "Activity Narrative": "Students continue to explore financial situations that involve repeated percent increase. They compare the effects of repeatedly applying different interest rates to a balance and graph the balances to see the\u00a0 amount owed over time. Students see that higher interest rates have an increasingly dramatic effect when compounded over many years on an unpaid balance.\nWhen graphing the functions, choosing an appropriate window may be challenging because the functions grow at very different rates. A small domain and range may appropriately show\u00a0the 12% loan, but the same domain and range can result in the graphs for the 24% and 30.6% loans leaving the screen quickly. A large domain and range may appropriately show the 30.6% loan balance but make the 12% loan balance rate look\u00a0constant.\nStudents could experiment with different domain and range values, though that may not be efficient. Prompt them to consider calculating the values of some expressions in the table to help them set an appropriate window for showing all three graphs meaningfully.\nStudents will likely produce continuous graphs although in the context the number of years is a whole number. The continuous graphs help to visualize\u00a0how the different interest rates influence the balance. If some students plot only the end-of-year balances, consider inviting them to share their graphs during the discussion.",

After \\(t\\) years?\u201d\u00a0(For 1 year, \\(2000 \\boldcdot (1 + 0.04)\\). For 2 years, \\(2000 \\boldcdot (1 + 0.04)^2\\). For \\(t\\) years, \\(2000 \\boldcdot (1+0.04)^t\\).)\n\u201cTo find the interest owed after 3 years, can we simply triple the interest charged after 1 year? Why or why not?\u201d\u00a0(We cannot just use 12% interest on \\$2,000 three times because after each year the new percentage interest is being applied to the original \\$2,000 as well as any interest from the previous years.)\n\u201cWhy can we represent an amount,\u00a0\\(a\\), increased by 4% as \\(a \\boldcdot (1.04)\\)? How did the 1.04 come about?\u201d\u00a0(We can think of 1.04 as 100% of the original cost plus an additional 4% interest, so that the total amount owed is 104% of the original amount borrowed, resulting in multiplying by 1.04.)",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "When we borrow money from a lender, the lender usually charges interest, a percentage of the borrowed amount as payment for allowing us to use the money. The interest is usually calculated at a regular interval of time (for example, daily,\u00a0monthly, or yearly).\nSuppose you received a loan of \\$500 and the interest rate is 15%, calculated at the end of each year. If you make no other purchases or payments, the amount owed after one year would be \\(500 + (0.15) \\boldcdot 500\\), or \\(500 \\boldcdot(1+0.15)\\). If you continue to make no payments or other purchases in the second year, the amount owed would increase by another 15%. The table shows the calculation of the amount owed for the first three years.\ntime in years | amount owed in dollars\n1 | \\(500 \\boldcdot(1+0.15)\\)\n2 | \\(500 \\boldcdot(1+0.15)(1+0.15)\\), or \\(500 \\boldcdot(1+0.15)^2\\)\n3 | \\(500 \\boldcdot(1+0.15)(1+0.15)(1+0.15)\\), or \\(500 \\boldcdot(1+0.15)^3\\)\nThe pattern here continues. Each additional year means multiplication by another factor of \\((1+0.15)\\). With no further purchases or payments, after \\(t\\) years the debt in dollars is given by the expression:\n\\(\\displaystyle 500\\boldcdot(1+0.15)^t\\)\nIn this representation, we might leave the growth factor as \\((1 + 0.15)\\) rather than combining it to 1.15 so that the percentage increase is easier to see. In other situations, it may make sense to write it as 1.15, depending on what is being emphasized. Because exponential functions eventually grow very quickly, leaving a debt unpaid can be very costly."
