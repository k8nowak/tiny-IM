    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students continue to examine two types of patterns by looking at tables, noting that one type is characterized by common differences and the other by common factors. They then match different representations with two contexts. This is an opportunity for students to notice structure in expressions (MP7) and to reason abstractly and quantitatively (MP2). Note that we are still not expecting students to use the words linear or exponential to describe these patterns, though they may naturally use the word linear to describe linear growth, since they have encountered these types of functions before.",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students use tables to make comparisons between 2 patterns. A table is particularly helpful for illustrating that:\nLinear functions grow by equal differences over equal intervals\nExponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals\nAt this stage, students simply observe these properties for a few particular functions and in the context of concrete problems. Toward the end of the unit, they will prove that these properties are true for any linear or exponential function.",

What do you wonder?\"\nAsk students to share the things that they noticed and wondered about.\nStudents may notice:\nThe number of stores nearly doubled between 1987 and 1988.\nThe number continued to grow by more than\u00a01.5 times per year (except from 1990 to 1991 and from 1991 to 1992).\nThey added close to 1,000 stores in 10 years.\nStudents may wonder:\nHow many stores do they have now?

(For the difference, subtract the number of stores in the row from the number of stores in the row above it. For example, in the 1988 row, the difference is 16 because \\(33 - 17 = 16\\). For the factor, divide the number of stores in the row by the number of stores in the row above it. For example, in the 1988 row, the factor is about 1.94 because \\(\\frac{33}{17} \\approx 1.94\\).)\nGive students access to a spreadsheet tool or a calculator. It is ideal if each student has their own device. Arrange students in groups of 2. If time is limited, ask one partner to complete the questions for Plan A and the other to do so for Plan B.",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Students may struggle to write an expression using the variable \\(n\\). Ask them to tell you any patterns they notice in the tables, and then encourage them to use those patterns to write an expression for \\(n\\).",

(Note that you might need to round the outcome to the nearest whole store.)",
        "Activity Synthesis": "To help students compare and contrast the two tables, ask:\n\u201cHow are the tables alike? Or how was the process of completing the two tables the same?\u201d (The tables both follow a simple pattern: Each table row is calculated by applying the same single arithmetic operation to the previous row. This pattern also holds for every other row or every third row, and so on.\u00a0The entries in both tables increase as we go down the table.)\n\u201cHow are the tables different? Or how was the process of completing the two tables different?\u201d (In Plan A, 20 new stores are added each year; the repeated arithmetic operation is addition. In Plan B, the number of stores is doubled each year; the repeated arithmetic operation is multiplication. Plan B grows much more quickly than does Plan A.)\nStudents may notice in the table that the difference from the number of stores the previous year is the same as the number of stores the previous year. This is because of the doubling pattern: to find the number of stores in the next year, the number from the previous year is added to itself (or doubled)."
