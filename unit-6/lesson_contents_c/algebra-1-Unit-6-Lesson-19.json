    "Lesson Narrative": "This lesson revisits the fact that exponential functions grow more quickly, eventually, than do linear functions. The first activity compares simple interest (linear growth) with compound interest (exponential growth). Students examine tables and graphs and see that the exponential function quickly overtakes the linear function. In the second activity, the exponential function is deliberately chosen to grow slowly over a large domain, making it less clear whether or not the exponential function will overtake the linear function.\nThe second activity provides an opportunity for students to strategically use technology (MP5), whether they make a graph (for which they will need to think carefully about the domain and range) or continue to tabulate explicit values of the two functions (likely with the aid of a calculator for the exponential function). This lesson provides multiple opportunities for students to justify their reasoning and critique the reasoning of others (MP3).",

        "Activity Narrative": "At the beginning of this unit, students compared linear and exponential growth. They return to this comparison in this lesson. This Warm-up aims to show that, visually, it could be very difficult to distinguish linear and exponential growth for some domain of the function. While any exponential function\u00a0eventually grows very quickly, it also can look remarkably linear over a portion\u00a0of the domain.",

An exponential function, however, can sometimes look linear, depending on the domain and range. Graphs are very helpful for seeing the general behavior of a function but not always for determining what kind of function is being graphed.\nConsider showing students this image of the graph showing a larger domain and range as well as the original window (the red rectangle in the lower left).\nImage description: <p>A graph.</p>\nOr show a dynamic graph of \\(y=120\\boldcdot(1.03)^x\\) starting with a small window in which\u00a0the graph looks linear and then zooming out until the curve is visible."

        "Activity Title": "Simple and Compound Interests",
        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students compare linear and exponential growth in a context involving simple and compound interest. The initial balances are chosen so that the two options stay pretty close for small values of time. The\u00a0intersection of their graphs is far enough from 0 that it is not easily noticed with only a few calculations. The graph for simple interest is linear. The graph for compound interest is exponential, but it is relatively flat for small values of time. As the domain values increase, students may notice that the values of the two options get closer and closer, or they may notice from the graph that the gap between the two graphs gets smaller.\nLook for students who make different choices for the investment option, as the better option would depend on the length of investment, which is unspecified. As in the case of the fish's offers in an earlier lesson, simple interest is better if the investment term is short, but compound interest becomes increasingly more favorable as time passes. Some students may not recognize this until they graph the two functions in the last question. Identify students who decide to change their earlier choice and can defend the change. Ask them to share later.",
        "Launch": "Arrange students in groups of 2. Encourage students to think quietly about the questions before conferring with their partner. Provide access to graphing technology.\nUse Three Reads to support reading comprehension and sense-making about this problem. Display only the problem stem and the tables, without revealing the questions.\nFor the first read, read the problem aloud then ask, \u201cWhat is this situation about?\u201d (different ways to invest money). Listen for and clarify any questions about the context.\nAfter the second read, ask students to list any quantities that can be counted or measured (interest rates, fees, initial amount invested).\nAfter the third read, reveal the question: \u201cWhich investment option should the family choose?\u201d and ask, \u201cWhat are some ways we might get started on this?\u201d Invite students to name some possible starting points, referring to\u00a0quantities from the second read (complete the table and look for patterns of how the values are calculated).\nRemind students that simple interest is found by\u00a0adding interest based only on the initial investment and does not compound by adding interest to the interest from previous time periods.",
        "Student Task Statement": "A family has \\$1,000 to invest and is considering two options: investing in government bonds that offer 2% simple interest, or investing in a savings account at a bank, which charges a $20 fee to open an account and pays 2% compound interest. Both options pay interest annually.\nHere are two tables showing what they would earn in the first couple of years if they do not invest additional amounts or withdraw any money.\nBonds\nyears of investment | amount in dollars\n0 | \\$1,000\n1 | \\$1,020\n2 | \\$1,040\n | \n | \nSavings Account\nyears of investment | amount in dollars\n0 | \\$980\n1 | \\$999.60\n2 | \\$1,019.59\n | \n | \nBonds: How does the investment grow with simple interest?\nSavings account: How are the amounts \\$999.60 and \\$1,019.59 calculated?\nFor each option, write an equation to represent the relationship between the amount of money and the number of years of investment.\nWhich investment option should the family choose? Use your equations or calculations to support your answer.\nUse graphing technology to graph the two investment options and show how the money grows in each.",

        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Consider surveying the class to see the choices that students made. Select students who made different choices to explain their responses, starting with those who opted for the bonds. Display their reasoning and graphs for all to see. If no students consider a time frame beyond 8 or 9 years, ask students which option would be better if the money could be left alone for 20 years. Discuss questions such as:\n\"How does the fee for the savings account affect the function?\" (It reduces the account balance, at the beginning, by \\$20. In the equation, there is a subtraction of 20.)\n\"Where can we see the fees on the graph?\" (The vertical intercept of the graph for the savings account is at 980, which is 20 less than 1,000.)\n\"When might the bonds be the better investment, if ever?\" (When the investment is shorter than a decade, as that is when the savings account surpasses it.)\n\"When might the savings account be the better investment, if ever?\" (When it is left for more than 10 years, after the compounding effects of interest make up for the initial fees.)\nPoint out that the exponential function here (the balance of the savings account) has a relatively slow rate of growth. It takes it a relatively long time before it overtakes the linear function, but it eventually does."

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity prompts students to again compare a linear function with an exponential one, but this time without a context, and the exponential function grows much more slowly over a long period of time.

Find a value of \\(x\\) for which properties of exponents allow you to conclude that \\(f(x)>g(x)\\) without a calculator.",
        "Activity Synthesis": "The goal of this discussion is to recognize that exponential functions will eventually be greater than linear functions, even when they initially grow slowly.\nDisplay, for all to see,\u00a02\u20133 approaches from previously selected students. Use Compare and Connect to help students compare, contrast, and connect the different approaches. Here are some questions for discussion:\n\u201cWhat do the approaches have in common? How are they different?\u201d\n\u201cDid anyone solve the problem the same way, but would explain it differently?\u201d\n\u201cHow does the value at 2,000 show up in each method?\u201d\nEmphasize that the table needs to be continued for a long time to identify when the values of \\(g\\) become greater than those of \\(f\\). Similarly, the window of the graph needs to be chosen carefully. A very efficient method is to identify that \\(f(1,\\!000)=2,\\!000\\) and then evaluate \\(g(1,\\!000)\\). Since \\(g(1,\\!000)\\) is much greater than 2,000, \\(g\\) reaches 2,000 first.\nIf not already illustrated by students who used graphing, show this dynamic sketch and zoom out:\nThough for quite a while it doesn't seem like the values of \\(g\\) would ever catch up with those of\u00a0\\(f\\), if the growth is allowed to take place long enough, exponential eventually surpasses linear."

    "Lesson Synthesis": "Help students review the features and behaviors of linear and exponential functions by presenting these pairs of functions (all of which represent growth):\nTwo linear functions\u00a0\\(f\\) and \\(g\\), for example:\u00a0\\(f(x)=\\frac12 x+100\\) and \\(g(x) = 2x\\)\nTwo exponential functions\u00a0\\(p\\) and \\(q\\), for example:\u00a0\\(p(x)= 100 \\boldcdot (1.5)^x\\) and \\(q(x) = 5 \\boldcdot 2^x\\)\nA linear function\u00a0\\(m\\)\u00a0and an exponential function\u00a0\\(n\\)\u00a0for example: \\(m(x) = 300x+ 1\\!,000\\) and \\(n(x) = (0.4)\\boldcdot 2^x\\)\nFor each pair for functions, ask students these questions:\n\"How can we tell which one grows more quickly?\"(When comparing two\u00a0linear functions, the slopes indicate how quickly they are growing. When comparing two\u00a0exponential functions, the one with the greater growth factor will grow faster (or decay less quickly). Exponential functions with growth factors greater than 1 will always eventually grow faster than linear functions.)\n\"Will the one that started out with the lower initial value\u00a0catch up with the function that starts with a higher initial value?\"\u00a0(In these examples, they will all catch up eventually.)\n\"What are some ways to check if one function will overtake another?\"\u00a0(The easiest way is to look at a graph and see if the higher graph eventually switches to being lower. You can also check input values to see if the output values have a different ordering for some inputs.)\nReiterate that even though an exponential function might seem to be growing too slowly to catch up to a linear function with large numbers for its \\(y\\)-intercept and slope, at some value of \\(x\\) down the line, the exponential function will catch up with the linear. Remind students how this was the case in the magical fish activity early in the unit. (The starting value for the linear function was 100,000 times that of the exponential function, and the slope of the linear function was 2,000 while the growth factor of the exponential function was 2. But within 3 weeks, the exponential function surpassed the linear.)",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "Suppose that you won the top prize from a game show and are given two options. The first option is a cash gift of \\$10,000 and \\$1,000 is added per day for the next 7 days. The second option is a cash gift of 1 cent (or \\$0.01) that grows tenfold each day for 7 days.\u00a0You must wait the entire time and get all of the prize money at the end of the week.\u00a0Which option would you choose?\nIn the first option, the amount of money increases by the same amount (\\$1,000) each day, so we can represent it with a linear function. In the second option, the money grows by multiples of 10, so we can represent it with an exponential function. Let \\(f\\) represent the amount of money \\(x\\) days after winning with the first option, and let \\(g\\) represent the amount of money \\(x\\) days after winning with the second option.\nOption 1:\u00a0\\(f(x) = 10,\\!000 + 1,\\!000x\\)\n\\(f(1)=11,\\!000\\)\\(f(2)=12,\\!000\\)\\(f(3)=13,\\!000\\). . .\\(f(6)=16,\\!000\\)\\(f(7)=17,\\!000\\)\nOption 2: \\(g(x) = (0.01) \\boldcdot 10^x\\)\n\\(g(1)=0.1\\)\\(g(2)=1\\)\\(g(3)=10\\). . .\\(g(6)=10,\\!000\\)\\(g(7)=100,\\!000\\)\nFor the first few days, the second option trails far behind the first. Because of the repeated multiplication by 10, however, after 7 days it surges past the amount in the first option.\nWhat if the factor of growth is much smaller than 10? Suppose we have a third option, represented by a function\u00a0\\(h\\). The starting amount is still \\$0.01 and it grows by a factor of 1.5 times each day. If we graph the function \\(h(x)=(0.01) \\boldcdot (1.5)^x\\), we see that it takes many, many more days before we see\u00a0rapid growth. But given time to continue growing, the amount in this exponential option will eventually also outpace that in the linear option.\u00a0If the prize rules are changed so that both prizes can grow for more than 38 days, this new exponential prize may be worth more than the linear option, but if the prizes can grow for only a shorter amount of time, the linear option is worth more.\nGraph of 2 functions on grid, origin O.
