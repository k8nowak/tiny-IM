    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students study a situation characterized by exponential change and learn the term\u00a0growth factor. They represent this relationship using a table, an expression, and a graph. They also explain the meaning of the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in an exponential expression \\(a \\boldcdot b^x\\), identifying their meaning in terms of a context (\\(a\\) is the initial amount, and \\(b\\) is the multiplier or growth factor) and also in terms of a graph (where \\(a\\) is the vertical intercept, and \\(b\\) determines how quickly the graph increases). Students interpret the different representations of growth in terms of a\u00a0bacteria population (MP2).\nThere is an optional activity intended to remind students of the convention that \\(a^0 = 1\\) for a non-zero number \\(a\\).\nTechnology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.",

Some examples are \\(2^5\\) and \\(2^{100}\\). Non-examples include \\(100^2\\) and \\(5\\boldcdot 2\\). It may be useful to further remind students that, for example, \\(2^5\\)\u00a0equals \\(2 \\boldcdot2 \\boldcdot2 \\boldcdot2 \\boldcdot2\\).\nTell students to close their books or devices (or to keep them closed). Reveal one problem at a time. For each problem:\nGive students quiet think time, and ask them to give a signal when they have an answer and a strategy.\nInvite students to share their strategies, and record and display their responses for all to see.\nUse the questions in the Activity Synthesis to involve more students in the conversation before moving to the next problem.\nKeep all previous problems and work displayed throughout the talk.",

If they struggle to complete the table, refocus their attention on the second row of the table and ask them if there is a different expression they could use for the number of bacteria after one hour.\nStudents may misread the directions and write the actual values in the table rather than expressions.

We can see why: An exponent is used to express the relationship.\nQuestions for discussion:\n\u201cIs the growth of the bacteria characterized by common differences or common factors?
