    "Lesson Narrative": "This lesson continues to examine quantities that decrease exponentially. They use the distributive property to rewrite expressions in which a quantity decreases by a factor of itself. For example, a \\$500 computer that loses \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of its value each year could be written as \\(500 - \\frac{1}{5} \\boldcdot 500\\) or as \\(500 \\boldcdot \\frac{4}{5}\\). An expression using only multiplication is easier to extend to multiple applications of the growth factor.\nUsing an exponent to express repeated decrease by the same factor is a good example of a generalization based on repeated calculation (MP8). Writing \\(500 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac45\\right)^t\\) expresses the computation of repeatedly decreasing by \\(\\frac15\\), \\(t\\) times.",

Invite these students to think through the\u00a0steps in Diego's calculation. What does the number 100 represent? What about the \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)?

        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite students to share their explanation of the steps in the first question and how they used similar reasoning for the other situations.\u00a0Make sure that students understand that a decreasing quantity can be expressed both ways, using subtraction or multiplication.\nReinforce the steps used in the first question by using this example:\u00a0\u201cThere were \\(x\\) dogs at the park and\u00a0\\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of the dogs were on a leash. How many dogs were not on a leash?\u201d Tell students that the number of dogs not on a leash could be expressed, using subtraction, as \\(x - \\frac{1}{5}x\\), but that's not a handy way to express it when working with a situation that is changing by a constant factor. Instead, we can factor that expression and write it as\u00a0\\(x(1 - \\frac{1}{5})\\)\u00a0to more clearly show how the value is changing over time. After combining terms and using the commutative property, we have an expression using only multiplication.\nEmphasize that it is important to be able to express this situation using multiplication because exponential situations involve quantities changing by a common factor (or being multiplied by a number)."

If needed, remind students of the method for using the distributive property to write \\(18,\\!000 - 18,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\frac{1}{3} = 18,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\frac{2}{3}\\).

        "Activity Synthesis": "The purpose of the discussion is for students to understand that when a quantity is decreased by a fraction \\(r\\) with \\(0 < r < 1\\), the quantity is multiplied by \\((1- r)\\) to find the reduced value.\nQuestions for discussion:\n\u201cWhy does it make sense to multiply an entry in one row by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) to get the entry for the next row?\u201d (Each year, only \\(\\frac23\\) of the car value remains.)\n\u201cWhy not write the expression for each year as subtraction, for instance, \\(18,\\!000 - \\frac13 \\boldcdot 18,\\!000\\)?\u201d (We could, but writing subtraction can get unwieldy quickly. For year 2, the expression would be \\((18,\\!000 - \\frac13 \\boldcdot 18,\\!000) - \\frac13 (18,\\!000 - \\frac13 \\boldcdot 18,\\!000)\\). If we calculate the value of each term it would be simpler (\\(12,\\!000 - \\frac13 \\boldcdot 12,\\!000\\)), but it would still not allow us to see a pattern and write a general expression as easily.)\n\u201cDoes the \\(\\frac45\\) in the last equation mean losing \\(\\frac45\\) of the value each year? Why or why not?\u201d (No. Multiplying by \\(\\frac 45\\) repeatedly means each time only \\(\\frac45\\) of the value remains, so the car is losing \\(\\frac15\\) of its value each year.)\n\u201cWill the value of the second car (starting at \\$10,000 and losing \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of it each year) ever be worth more than the first car (starting at \\$18,000 and losing\u00a0\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of it each year)? Explain.\u201d (Yes. After 4 years, the value of the second car will be \\$4,096 while the value of the first car will be \\$3,555.56)\nMake sure that students understand that the exponential expression for the value of the cars after \\(t\\) years came from multiplying by the growth factor (\\(\\frac23\\), or $\\frac\\(\\frac{4}{5}\\)$)\u00a0repeatedly (\\(t\\) times)."

    "Student Lesson Summary": "Sometimes a quantity\u00a0grows by the same factor at regular intervals. For example, a population might double\u00a0every year. Sometimes a quantity\u00a0decreases\u00a0by the same factor at regular intervals. For example, a car might lose one third of its value every year.\nLet's look at a situation in which the quantity decreases by the same factor at regular intervals. Suppose a bacteria population starts at\u00a0100,000, and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the population dies each day. The population one day later is\u00a0\\(100,\\!000 - \\frac14 \\boldcdot 100,\\!000\\), which can be written as\u00a0\\(100,\\!000 \\left(1 - \\frac14\\right)\\). The population after one day is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) of\u00a0100,000 or\u00a075,000. The population after two days is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\u00a0\\boldcdot 75,\\!000\\). Here are some further values for the bacteria population\nnumberof days | bacteria population\n0 | 100,000\n1 | 75,000 (or \\(100,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\frac34\\))\n2 | 56,250 (or \\(100,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\frac34 \\boldcdot \\frac34\\), or \\(100,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac34\\right)^2\\))\n3 | about 42,188 (or \\(100,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\frac34 \\boldcdot \\frac34 \\boldcdot \\frac34\\), or \\(100,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac34\\right)^3\\))\nIn general, \\(d\\) days after the bacteria population was 100,000, the population\u00a0\\(p\\)\u00a0is given\u00a0by the equation: \\(\\displaystyle p = 100,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^d,\\) with one factor of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) for each day.\nSituations with quantities that decrease exponentially are described\u00a0with the term\u00a0exponential decay. The multiplier (\\(\\frac34\\) in this case) is still called the growth factor, though sometimes people call it the\u00a0decay factor instead."
