    "Lesson Narrative": "The purpose of this lesson is for students to revisit the idea of average rate of change and apply it to exponential functions. While rate of change has an unambiguous meaning for linear functions, for nonlinear functions rates of change are not constant, so an interval must be specified.\nIn this lesson, students first are invited to recall how to calculate an average rate of change for a specific interval for a function represented by a data table. By comparing the average rate of change of different intervals that all start at the same point, students can observe that while the average rate of change can describe how the data is changing with reasonable accuracy over some intervals, it is not a good predictor over larger intervals, because exponential functions do not have a constant rate of change. Contexts are used throughout this lesson to give students an opportunity to reason abstractly and quantitatively (MP2).",

        "Activity Narrative": "The purpose of this Warm-up is for students to recall how to calculate an average rate of change from two points. Students will use this skill throughout the lesson and return to the context and data table\u00a0in the last activity of the lesson.",
        "Launch": "Display the table for all to see. Ask students to describe how quickly \\(p(t)\\) is decreasing between 1977 (\\(t=0\\)) and 1978 (\\(t=1\\)) and then how it is decreasing between 1986 (\\(t=9\\)) and 1987 (\\(t=10\\)). (In the first year on the table it\u2019s decreasing by 20. In the last year on the table, it decreases only by 1.5.)",
        "Student Task Statement": "Let \\(p\\) be the function that gives the cost\u00a0\\(p(t)\\), in dollars, of producing 1 watt of solar energy \\(t\\) years after 1977. Here is a table showing the values of \\(p\\) from 1977 to 1987.\n\\(t\\) | \\(p(t)\\)\n0 | 80\n1 | 60\n2 | 45\n3 | 33.75\n4 | 25.31\n5 | 18.98\n6 | 14.24\n7 | 10.68\n8 | 8.01\n9 | 6.01\n10 | 4.51\nWhich expression\u00a0can be used to calculate the average rate of change in solar cost between 1977 and 1987?\n\\(p(10)-p(0)\\)\n\\(p(10)\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{p(10) - p(0)}{10-0}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{p(10)}{p(0)}\\)",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students might confuse finding an average of the values in the table and finding an average rate of change. Help them see that average usually involves one unit, such as average number of cookies. Average rate of change involves comparing how\u00a0one quantity changes when another quantity changes by 1, such as cost ($) per year.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "The goal of this discussion is for students to recall the meaning of average rate of change for a function and how it is calculated. Select students to describe what the value of each expression represents in this context. For example, \\(p(10)-p(0)\\) is the difference in cost for a solar cell between 1977 and 1987 while\u00a0\\(\\dfrac{p(10)}{p(0)}\\) could be used to identify the percent change from 1977 to 1987. An important takeaway for students is that the actual expression for the average rate of change, \\(\\dfrac{p(10)-p(0)}{10-0} \\approx \\text-7.55\\), tells us that the price decreased by -\\$7.55 each year on average, because\u00a0the expression looks at the total difference in price between 1977 and 1987, divided by the total number of years that passed."

        "Activity Narrative": "Earlier in the course, students looked at constant rates of change in\u00a0linear functions. In this activity, they begin to explore average rates of change in an exponential growth function. In particular, the focus for this activity is on how exponential functions have different rates of change for different input intervals, which was not the case for linear functions.\nIn the next activity, they investigate average rates of growth in a decay function. In both cases, they revisit contexts from earlier lessons.",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "If students struggle with a rate of change that is not constant like the slope they saw in linear relationships,\u00a0ask if they can draw a straight line between all the points on the graph in question 3. Spend time on the graph in the synthesis so the lines can help them see why the rate of change varies with an exponential function.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "For the third question, make sure students see that when they calculated the average rate of change for each of the three time periods, they were in effect finding the slope of the line that goes through two points that represent the starting year and the ending year. Display a graph like the one shown here to help illustrate this point:\nImage description: <p>11 points on coordinate plane. Lines connect first point to fourth, seventh, and eleventh points. Horizontal axis from 0 to 10, time in years. Vertical axis from 0 to 1500, number of coffee shops.</p>\nThe line that connects the points for 1987 and 1990 fit the data for that period fairly well, so the slope of that line (the average rate of change between those two points) describes the growth in those three years fairly accurately. In contrast, the line that connects the points for 1987 and 1997, does not at all fit the data, so the slope of that line does not paint an accurate picture of how the company was growing that decade.\nHere are some questions for discussion\n\u201cWould the average rate of change between 1994 and 1997 accurately depict how the company was growing in the last three years in the data?\u201d ( Yes, because the average rate of change from 1994 to 1997 is 329 shops per year because\u00a0\\(\\dfrac{1412-425}{10-7}= 329\\). The actual number of shops increased by 252, 338, and then 397 from 1994 to 1997, respectively.)\n\u201cWould the average rate of change between any 2 years accurately reflect the growth for all of 1987 to 1997?\u201d (No, because the number of shops is increasing at an increasing rate, an average of two values is not enough to summarize the growth of the company.)"

    "Student Lesson Summary": "When we calculate the average rate of change for a linear function, no matter what interval we pick, the value of the rate of change\u00a0is the same. A constant rate of change is an important feature of linear functions! When a linear function is represented by a graph, the slope of the line is the rate of change of the function.\nExponential functions also have important features. We've learned about exponential growth and exponential decay, both of which are characterized by a constant quotient over equal intervals. But what does this mean for the value of the average rate of change for an exponential function over a specific interval?\nLet's look at an exponential function that we studied\u00a0earlier. Let \\(A\\) be the function that models the area,\u00a0\\(A(t)\\), in square yards, of algae covering a pond \\(t\\) weeks after beginning treatment to control the algae bloom. Here is a table showing about how many square yards of\u00a0algae remain during the first 5 weeks of treatment.\n\\(t\\) | \\(A(t)\\)\n0 | 240\n1 | 80\n2 | 27 \n3 | 9\n4 | 3\nThe average rate of change of \\(A\\) from the start of treatment to Week 2 is about -107 square yards per week because\u00a0\\(\\dfrac{A(2)-A(0)}{2-0} \\approx \\text-107\\). The average rate of change of \\(A\\) from Week 2 to Week 4, however, is only about -12 square yards per week because\u00a0\\(\\dfrac{A(4)-A(2)}{4-2} \\approx \\text-12\\).\nThe negative average rates of change show that \\(A\\) is decreasing over both intervals, but the average rate of change for the time during Weeks 0 to 2 indicates that the values are decreasing more rapidly than during Weeks 2 to 4\u00a0due to the effect of the decay factor. For an exponential function with a growth factor greater than 1, the values for the average rate of change of each interval are positive, with the second interval increasing more quickly\u00a0due to the effect of the growth factor."
