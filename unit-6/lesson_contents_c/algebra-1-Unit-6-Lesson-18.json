    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students examine different ways to express repeated percent increase. Using rules of exponents, it is possible to group exponential expressions in different ways to highlight different aspects of a situation. For example, if an investment of \\$1,000 grows by 1% each month, then the value of the investment after 4 years can be written as \\(1,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\left( (1+0.01)^{12} \\right)^4\\) or as \\(1,\\!000 \\boldcdot (1.1268)^4\\) because \\((1.01)^{12} \\approx 1.1268\\).\nIn this lesson, we distinguish between growth rate (previously known as percent change or interest rate) and growth factor (defined earlier in this unit). In functions of the form \\(a \\boldcdot (1+r)^x\\), the growth rate is \\(r\\), and the growth factor is \\(1+r\\).\nAs students\u00a0write and work across different expressions, they practice using structure and repeated reasoning (MP7 and MP8). In choosing an expression strategically to highlight a particular aspect of the situation, they reason abstractly and concretely (MP2).\nTechnology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.",

It encourages students to think about the equivalence of values with exponents and to rely on rules of exponents to mentally solve problems. The strategies elicited here will be helpful later in the lesson when students adjust growth rates to different units of time.\nTo compare the values with exponents, students need to look for and make use of structure (MP7).\nIn describing their strategies, students need to be precise in their word choice and use of language (MP6).",

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity allows students to practice interpreting and using exponential expressions to solve problems, as well as writing equivalent expressions that allow new insights into the situation. It examines the percent change of the United States population from its beginning through the Civil War. During this time frame, the population happened to be modeled remarkably well by an exponential function.\nStudents are given a population model in which time is measured in years. They then write different models in which time is measured in decades or centuries. While the century model is primarily of theoretical interest, the decade model is very appropriate for showing the overall growth rate of the United States during this period, reinforcing the compounding effects of exponential growth.\nIn the Activity Synthesis, the term growth rate is defined.\nMaking graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Students may miss that the problem specifies that the \\(P\\) value from the equation represents thousands of people. Suggest a closer reading and thinking about whether a population for the country in 1790 of 4,000 makes sense.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Focus the discussion on how students found the percent increase per decade and per century. Ask students:\n\"By what percentage did the U.S. population increase per decade?\" (\\((1.031)^{10} \\approx 1.36\\), so the population grew by around 36% each decade.)\n\"By what percentage did it increase per century?\" (The growth factor, \\((1.031)^{100}\\), is about 21.18. Subtracting 1 for the original 100% of the population\u00a0gives 20.18. This means it grew by\u00a02,018%.)\nExplain\u00a0that in situations characterized by exponential change by a percentage, people sometimes refer to the percent change as a growth rate. (In previous lessons, this idea was called interest rate in the specific context of interest on savings or debt, but growth rate is a more general term.)\nMake sure that students understand how growth rate is related to growth factor. For example, in the equation \\(P = 4,\\!000 \\boldcdot (1.031)^t\\), the growth factor is 1.031, and the growth rate is 0.031, which can also be expressed as 3.1%.\nTo connect the key ideas in this lesson and the past few lessons, discuss questions such as:\n\"Is the growth rate per decade ten times the growth rate per year? Why or why not?\" (No. The growth is compounded over time. Between 1790 and 1791, the population grows by 3.1% of 4,000 so, in thousands, that's 12.4, giving 4,012.4. Between 1791 and 1792, the population in thousands will grow by 3.1% of 4,012.4. So for the second year, the growth is 3.1% of 4,000 plus 3.1% of 12.4 from the first year. And so on. So the growth rate per decade is more than \\(3.1 \\boldcdot 10\\).)\n\"Which growth rate is easiest or most helpful for understanding the population change in that period? Why might that be?\" (Perhaps the easiest to grasp is the growth rate per decade, about a third per decade. The yearly growth is relatively small, so it is hard to appreciate. The growth per century is very large.)\n\"If we use the model by year to find the population in 2017, what would it be?\" (About 4 billion people. In thousands, it is \\(4,\\!000 \\boldcdot (1.031)^{227} \\approx 4,\\!090,\\!505.78\\). It is different from the actual population in 2017\u00a0by more than a factor of 10)\n\"What might be a reason that the population calculated using the model is so far off from the actual number?\" (A variety of reasons, but one factor is that limits in land and resources made it unlikely for the population to continue to grow at the same rate over time.)"

As students trade roles explaining their thinking and listening, they have opportunities to explain their reasoning and to critique the reasoning of others (MP3).\nThe expressions are difficult to calculate,\u00a0so students will need to rely on structure (MP7). From this point of view, the key part of the expression is what is on the inside of the innermost parentheses. The decimal part of this (0.07) represents the annual interest rate while the denominator (2 and 12) represents how frequently the interest is compounded.\nLook for students who focus on the structure of the expressions and what each part of the expression means in context. Invite these students to share during the discussion.",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students may need a reminder that semi-annually means twice per year, or every 6 months.\nStudents may not understand the denominator of the fraction included in the expressions.

It is the effective annual interest rate.)\n\"What does the exponent 6 mean in \\(\\left(\\left(1 + \\frac{0.07}{12}\\right)^{12}\\right)^6\\)?\" (It is the number of years that the account earns interest, which is 6 years.)"

    "Lesson Synthesis": "Today we looked at how exponential functions can be written in different ways in order to be more meaningful. Invite students to articulate how this is so, using an example such as the following.\nAfter taking a dose of 0.2 mg, the amount of medicine,\u00a0\\(m\\), in a person's body, in mg, can be modeled by three different equations based on the units of time used to measure the change. Let\u00a0\\(h\\), \\(d\\), and \\(w\\) represent the number of hours, days, and weeks, respectively, since taking the medicine. \\(\\displaystyle m = (0.2) \\boldcdot (0.996)^h\\),\u00a0\\(\\displaystyle m = (0.2) \\boldcdot \\left((0.996)^{24}\\right)^d\\), \u00a0\\(\\displaystyle m = (0.2) \\boldcdot \\left((0.996)^{168}\\right)^w\\)\n\"What does each equation tell us? What does the 0.996 represent? What do the 24 and 168 represent?\"\u00a0(The equations tell us how much medicine is still in the person\u2019s body at different units of time.\u00a0The 0.996 represents the growth rate of the function and is related to the percentage that is still left in the body after each hour. The 24 represents that there are 24 hours in a day and the 168 represents that there are 168 hours in a week.)\n\"Which of the equations, if any, gives us a clear picture of how the body breaks down the medicine? Why is that?\"\u00a0(The equation using weeks as the unit of time may make the most sense because it takes about a week to get to half of the original amount, so this time scale is the easiest to think about.)\n\"\\((0.996)^{24} \\approx 0.91\\) and\\((0.996)^{168}\\approx 0.51\\). What do 0.91 and 0.51 tell us? Do they give us a clearer idea of how the medicine breaks down? How?\"\u00a0(0.91 is the growth factor for the amount of medicine in the body each day. 0.51 is the growth factor for the amount of medicine in the body after a week. It means that each day about 91% of the medicine from the previous day is still in the body and that each week about 51% of it is still in the body from the previous week. It is easier for me to understand 51% as about half each week than it is for me to think about 91% each day or 99.6% each hour.)",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "Expressions can be written in different ways to highlight different aspects of a situation or to help us better understand what is happening. A growth rate tells us the percent change. As always, in percent change situations, it is important to know if the change is an increase or decrease. For example:\nA population is increasing by 20% each year. The growth rate is 20%, so after one year, 0.2 times the population at the beginning of that year is being added. \u00a0If the initial population is \\(p\\), the new population is \\(p + 0.2p\\), which equals \\((1 + 0.2)p\\), or \\(1.2p\\).\nA population is decreasing by 20% each year. The growth rate is -20%, so after one year, 0.2 times the population at the beginning of that year is being lost. \u00a0If the initial population is \\(p\\), the new population is \\(p \u2013 0.2p\\), which equals \\((1 \u2013 0.2)p\\), or \\(0.8p\\).\nSuppose the area,\u00a0\\(a\\), covered by a forest is currently 50 square miles, and it\u00a0is growing by 0.2% each year. If \\(t\\) represents time, from now, in years,\u00a0we can express\u00a0the area of the forest as:\n\\(\\displaystyle a = 50 \\boldcdot (1+0.002)^t\\)\n\\(\\displaystyle a = 50 \\boldcdot (1.002)^t\\)\nIn this situation, the growth rate is 0.002, and the growth factor is 1.002. Because 0.002 is such a small number, however, it may be difficult to tell from this function how quickly the forest is growing. We may find it more meaningful to measure the growth every decade or every century. There are 10 years in a decade, so to find the growth rate in decades, we can use the expression \\((1.002)^{10}\\), which is approximately 1.02. This means a growth rate of about 2% per decade. Using \\(d\\) for time, in decades, the area of the forest can be expressed as:\n\\(\\displaystyle a=50 \\boldcdot \\left((1+0.002)^{10}\\right)^d\\)\n\\(\\displaystyle a \\approx50 \\boldcdot (1.02)^d\\)\nIf we measure time in centuries, the growth rate is about 22% per century because \\(1.002^{100} \\approx 1.22\\). Using \\(c\\) to measure time, in centuries, our equation for area\u00a0becomes:\n\\(\\displaystyle a = 50 \\boldcdot \\left((1+0.002)^{100}\\right)^c\\)\n\\(\\displaystyle a \\approx 50 \\boldcdot (1.22)^c\\)"
