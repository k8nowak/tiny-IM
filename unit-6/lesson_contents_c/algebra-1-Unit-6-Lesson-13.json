    "Lesson Narrative": "This\u00a0optional lesson provides additional practice investigating\u00a0 the relationship between the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the expression \\(a \\boldcdot b^x\\) and a graph representing the function\u00a0\\(f\\)\u00a0given by \\(f(x) = a \\boldcdot b^x\\). Students start by identifying a function represented by a given graph and using the graph to make sense of a situation. They also examine two abstract graphs, with unlabeled axes, and decide which one represents a given situation. This level of abstraction is appropriate at this stage. It gives students an opportunity to apply what they have learned about the relationship between an exponential context and its graph, and to use graphs to better interpret the contexts. In both cases, they rely on their understanding of the connections between the parameters in an exponential expression and the features of an exponential graph (MP7) to answer questions.",

Here they work in the opposite direction,\u00a0analyzing\u00a0graphs and creating\u00a0corresponding equations. In the first question, the coordinates given are not of two consecutive values of \\(x\\), so students need to reason about the decay factor indirectly.

        "Activity Synthesis": "Select students to share their responses to the first question. Focus the discussion on how students found the decay factor for the computer. Make sure students understand that the key is to notice that every 2 years, the computer's value is multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). This means that the annual decay factor is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), because\u00a0\\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\).\nFor the last graph, discuss questions such as:\n\u201cWhat information is needed to describe an exponential function?\u201d (the factor of growth or decay and the initial value)\n\u201cWhere on the graph do we see the initial value?\u201d (the \\(y\\)-intercept of the graph)\n\u201cWhat points on the graph can we use to help us find the growth factor?\u201d (the points \\((\\text-1, 40)\\) and \\((0,20)\\), or\\((0,20)\\) and \\((2,5)\\))\n\u201cWhy might \\((\\text-1,40)\\) and \\((0,20)\\) be a more strategic choice than \\((0,20)\\) and \\((2,5)\\) for finding the factor of growth?\u201d (The \\(x\\) coordinates of first two points differ by 1, so the quotient of the \\(y\\) coordinates of those points can be used to find the factor of decay. It is a more direct way to find the factor of decay, which is the factor by which the output of \\(f\\) changes when the input,\u00a0\\(x\\), changes by 1.

    "Student Lesson Summary": "If we have enough information about a graph representing an exponential function \\(f\\), we can write a corresponding equation. Here is a graph\u00a0of \\(y = f(x)\\).\nAn equation defining an exponential function has the form \\(f(x) = a \\boldcdot b^x\\). The value of \\(a\\) is the starting value or \\(f(0)\\), so it is the \\(y\\)-intercept of the graph. We can see that \\(f(0)\\) is 500 and that the function is decreasing.\nGraph of a function on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, x, from 0 to 4, by 2's. Vertical axis, y. from 0 to 600, by 200's. Plotted points as follows: 0 comma 500, 1 comma 300. Line is drawn through the points, moving downward and to the right.\nImage description: <p>Graph of a function on grid.</p>\nThe value of \\(b\\) is the growth factor. It is the number by which we multiply the function\u2019s output at \\(x\\) to get the output at \\(x+1\\). To find this growth factor for \\(f\\), we can calculate \\(\\frac{f(1)}{f(0)}\\), which is \\(\\frac{300}{500}\\)\u00a0(or \\(\\frac35\\)). So an equation that defines \\(f\\) is:\n\\(\\displaystyle f(x) = 500 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^x\\)\nWe can also use graphs to compare functions. Here are graphs representing two different exponential functions, labeled \\(g\\) and \\(h\\). Each one represents the area of algae (in square meters) in a pond, \\(x\\) days after certain fish were introduced.\nPond A had 40 square meters of algae. Its area shrinks to \\(\\frac{8}{10}\\) of the area on the previous day.\nPond B had 50 square meters of algae. Its area shrinks to \\(\\frac 25\\) of the area on the previous day.\nGraph of 2 functions on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, x, Vertical axis, y. Function h, blue line, starts on the vertical axis, \u00a0moves downward and to the right, almost linearly.. Function g, green line, starts above function h, moves downward and to the right, exponentially.\nImage description: <p>Graph of 2 functions on a grid.</p>\nCan you tell which graph corresponds to which algae population?\nWe can see that the \\(y\\)-intercept of \\(g\\)'s graph is greater than the \\(y\\)-intercept of \\(h\\)'s graph. We can also see that \\(g\\) has a smaller growth factor than \\(h\\) because as \\(x\\) increases by the same amount, \\(g\\) is retaining a smaller fraction of its value compared to \\(h\\). This suggests that \\(g\\) corresponds to Pond B, and \\(h\\) corresponds to Pond A."
