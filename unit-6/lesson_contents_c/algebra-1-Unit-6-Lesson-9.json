    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students study exponential functions and their graphs in context. Given a graph or a description of a relationship, they write one quantity as a function of another and then use the function to answer questions about the context. They also produce graphs of exponential functions, paying close attention to the appropriate domain and range, which are both restricted by the context (MP2,\u00a0MP6).",

        "Activity Narrative": "This Warm-up addresses a common confusion among students mistaking the expression \\(2^x\\) for the expression \\(x^2\\). One good way to address this confusion is by evaluating the expressions for different values of \\(x\\), which is the path students are likely to take here. Another way to illustrate the distinction is by graphing, though students are less likely to take this approach.",
        "Launch": "Display the task for all to see, and ask students to read it quietly to themselves. Ask what they think Lin means by equivalent. They may remember from earlier grades, or they may guess based on contrasting her statement with Diego\u2019s statement. Before they start working, be sure that students understand equivalent to mean equal no matter what value is used in place of \\(x\\).",
        "Student Task Statement": "Lin and Diego are discussing two expressions: \\(x^2\\) and \\(2^x\\).\nLin says, \u201cI think the two expressions are equivalent.\u201d\nDiego says, \u201cI think the two expressions are equal only for some values of \\(x\\).\u201d\nDo you agree with either of them?

When\u00a0\\(x\\) is an odd number, the value of \\(2^x\\) will be even because of the multiplication by 2. But multiplying an\u00a0odd-number \\(x\\) by itself as in \\(x^2\\)will result in an odd number, so we know that in those instances the expressions are not equal.

        "Activity Title": "Cost of Solar Cells",
        "Activity Narrative": "Previously, students were presented with descriptions of functions and, in one case, an equation that represents a function. In this activity, students are given the graph of a function and asked to analyze the underlying relationship and describe it using function notation.\nThe data used in this task are approximate, but the costs of solar energy during the time period mentioned in this activity can be appropriately modeled by an exponential decay model.\nInterpreting statements such as \\(f(4)=25\\) in terms of the context is a chance to highlight precision in language (MP6), for example, to articulate that the 4 means 4 years after 1977 (or 1981), and the value \\(f(2)=45\\) means that each watt produced via solar energy cost \\$45 in 1979.",
        "Launch": "Elicit what students already know about solar cells. If students are unfamiliar with solar power and units of measurement for energy, give a brief introduction. Solar cells turn energy from the Sun into electricity, a form of energy that is useful to humans. Energy is measured using units called watts. Over the course of the past several decades, the cost of solar cells has decreased. That is, we can manufacture solar cells that generate the same amount of electricity for less money.\nRead the opening sentence of the task, and display the graph for all to see. To help them process the information in the graph and think about functions, ask if the price per watt is a function of time and if the time is a function of the price per watt.",
        "Student Task Statement": "The cost, in dollars, to produce 1 watt of solar energy is a function of the number of years since 1977, \\(t\\).\nFrom 1977 to 1987, the cost could be modeled by an exponential function,\u00a0\\(f\\). Here is the graph of the function.\nImage description: <p>A sheet of solar panels.</p>\nGraph of a function on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, years since 1977, from 0 to 11 by 1's.

What does that value of \\(t\\) represent in this context?\nBy what factor did the cost of solar cells change each year? (If you get stuck, consider creating a table.)",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "If students struggle with the function notation in\u00a0the questions, ask them to recall what each part of what \u201cf(t)\u201d means, or remind them that the \\(f\\) is the name of the function, and the \\(t\\) is the input value.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Focus the discussion on how students selected points on the graph to calculate the growth factor. Strategically, it is important to choose values of time \\(t\\) so that the price per watt \\(f(t)\\), in dollars, is unambiguous (for example \\(t=0, t=1\\),\u00a0and \\(t = 2\\)). Because we are told that the price decreases exponentially, two values are enough to find the growth factor."

        "Activity Title": "Paper Folding",
        "Activity Narrative": "This activity prompts students to graph equations\u00a0to solve problems and think about appropriate values of their variables. The context is the thickness and the area of a sheet of paper that is repeatedly folded.\nFor both equations, only whole numbers make sense as inputs. Students consider why this makes sense in this context. (This is in contrast, for example, to the price of producing solar energy in the earlier activity. While the data given is on an annual basis, it makes\u00a0sense to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d because there is a price for producing solar energy at any given time.) Without instruction about how to create a discrete graph with their graphing technology, students are likely to produce a continuous graph. This is a good opportunity to discuss how to interpret a model for a particular context (MP4).\nLook for the different ways that students use to find out how many folds are needed to reach a certain thickness. Identify students who used a table, a graph, or an equation so they can share later.",
        "Launch": "Give each student a sheet of paper. Ask them to fold it in half, and in half again, as many times as they can. (To save paper, you might have students do this in pairs.) Once they have folded it as many times as they can, ask a few students to share how many times they folded it, and estimate the thickness of the folded paper. Tell students that they are going to investigate the relationship between the number of folds and the thickness of the paper.\nProvide access to graphing technology. It is ideal if each student has their own device. This activity requires students to be mindful about the scale or graphing window. The activities that specifically target that skill are optional, so this gives students a chance to practice scaling the axes.",
        "Student Task Statement": "The thickness,\u00a0\\(t\\), in millimeters of a folded sheet of paper after it is folded \\(n\\) times is given by\u00a0the equation\u00a0\\(t = (0.05) \\boldcdot 2^n\\).\tWhat does the number \\(0.05\\) represent in the equation?Use graphing technology to graph the equation \\(t =\u00a0(0.05) \\boldcdot 2^n\\).How many folds does it take before the folded sheet of paper is more than 1 mm thick?

        "Activity Synthesis": "Focus the discussion on:\nHow students identified the growth factor, given an\u00a0equation or a description.\nHow students determined how many folds are needed to reach a certain thickness. Invite previously identified students to share their strategies.\nThe meaningful values of the variables in the equations:\tHighlight that a discrete graph is more appropriate in both situations: Only the whole-number values make sense for the number of folds because it is not possible to fold the paper a fractional number of times.Practically speaking, a large number of folds, such as 36, is not possible.\nHighlight that a discrete graph is more appropriate in both situations: Only the whole-number values make sense for the number of folds because it is not possible to fold the paper a fractional number of times.\nPractically speaking, a large number of folds, such as 36, is not possible.\nDemonstrate, using graphing technology, how to graph the equations, and invite students to share how they chose an appropriate graphing window. If students just typed an equation, most likely\u00a0the tool plotted a continuous curve. This is an opportunity to talk about interpreting the continuous graph in this context: Really, only whole-number values for \\(n\\)\u00a0are meaningful. Time permitting, you might demonstrate how to graph only whole number\u00a0values of \\(n\\), using your graphing technology of choice. Typically, this is done by using the technology to generate a table based on a rule. Here is an example:\nTime permitting, consider asking students if the equations \\(t = (0.05)\\boldcdot 2^n \\) and \\(a = (93.5) \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\) could be plotted on the same set of axes. Even though the variable \\(n\\) (the number of folds) is the same\u00a0for\u00a0the two equations, the thickness,\u00a0\\(t\\), and the area,\u00a0\\(a\\), are measured in different units and so cannot be plotted on the same axes.\nImage description: <p>Two column table next to its discrete function graph.</p>"

        "Activity Narrative": "This optional activity gives students an additional opportunity to apply what they know about key characteristics of an exponential function and use it to model real-world data. Unlike previous activities, the data have not been adjusted to perfectly fit an exponential model. Students will need to make estimates and think strategically about what model to choose. Because the years chosen for data points are close together, students may use repeated multiplication to answer the questions rather than writing and evaluating an expression that models the exponential function.\nThe Information Gap structure requires students to make sense of problems by determining what information is necessary, and then to ask for information they need to solve it. This may take several rounds of discussion if their first requests do not yield the information they need (MP1). It also allows them to refine the language they use and to ask increasingly more precise questions until they get the information they need (MP6).\nIn Problem Card 1, answers will vary based on the data points and the strategy students use to find the growth factor. Strategies to watch for include:\nEstimating\u00a0that the phone sales are roughly doubling each year and using\u00a0that to estimate future sales\nCalculating\u00a0a growth factor using the data from two consecutive years\nFinding the average of the growth factors between 2008 and 2009 and between 2009 and 2010\nFor Problem Card 2, the third approach\u00a0will not arise because only two sales numbers are available on the data card.",

Display, for all to see, the Information Gap graphic that illustrates a framework for the routine.Remind students of the structure of the Information Gap routine, and consider demonstrating the protocol if students are unfamiliar with it.\u00a0Arrange students in groups of 2. In each group, give a problem card to one student and a data card to the other student. After reviewing their work on the first problem, give students the cards for a second problem, and instruct them to switch roles.",

Invite students to share different ways they estimated a growth factor for smartphone sales, such as those mentioned in the activity narrative.\nThe first of these methods is efficient and allows for quick\u00a0calculations. It is not as accurate, however, as the other estimates and may lead to a less reliable prediction.\u00a0In this case, it leads to an overestimate of phone sales because the actual growth\u00a0factors are less than 2.\nConsider showing a model and a graph generated using\u00a0graphing technology. Based on this model, about 125 million of that brand of smartphones were sold in 2012.\nImage description: <p>A graph. Total smartphone sales in millions.

Discuss questions such as:\n\u201cAccording to your model, how many smartphones were sold worldwide in 2018?\u201d (About 5 billion.)\n\u201cThe world population in 2018 is about 7.6 billion. Is the number of smartphones sold based on your model realistic? Why or why not?\u201d (No. \u00a0Allowing for children, the elderly, and underdeveloped countries, 66% of the population buying one brand of smartphone is not realistic.)\n\u201cCould the sales of smartphones continue to grow exponentially? Why or why not?\u201d (No. There is a finite number of people who will buy a particular brand of smartphone. The data should level off, with surges when new models come out.)"

    "Lesson Synthesis": "In this lesson, we used exponential functions to answer questions about different situations. In a previous lesson, we saw that a function\u00a0\\(f\\)\u00a0defined by\u00a0\\(f(t) = 240 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^t\\) represents the area of algae in square yards after \\(t\\) weeks of treatment. Discuss how the equation could be used to:\nProduce a graph.\nFind\u00a0the area of the algae 6 weeks after treatment.\nFind out when the algae would drop below 10 square yards.\nAsk students what \\(f(1)=80\\) and \\(f(2)=\\frac{80}{3}\\) mean in this context. To reiterate the importance of choosing an appropriate graphing window, ask students to give examples of a graphing window that would be appropriate (or inappropriate) for this function. Time permitting, use graphing technology to demonstrate the outcomes of their suggestions.",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "Earlier, we used equations to represent situations characterized by exponential change.\u00a0For example, to describe the amount of caffeine,\u00a0\\(c\\), in a person\u2019s body \\(t\\) hours after an initial measurement of 100 mg, we used the equation \\(c = 100\\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^t\\).\nNotice that the amount of caffeine is a function of time, so another way to express this relationship is \\(c = f(t)\\), where \\(f\\) is the function given by\u00a0\u00a0\\(f(t)=100 \\boldcdot \\left( \\frac{9}{10} \\right)^t\\).\nWe can use this function to analyze the amount of caffeine. For example, when \\(t\\) is 3, the amount of caffeine in the body is \\(100 \\boldcdot\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^3\\)or \\(100 \\boldcdot \\frac{729}{1,000}\\), which is 72.9. The statement \\(f(3) = 72.9\\)\u00a0means that 72.9 mg of caffeine are present 3 hours after the initial measurement.\nWe can also graph the function\u00a0\\(f\\)\u00a0to better understand what is happening. The point labeled \\(P\\), for example, has the approximate coordinates\u00a0\\((10,35)\\) so\u00a0it takes about 10 hours after the initial measurement for the caffeine level to decrease to\u00a035 mg.\nGraph of function, origin O. Horizontal axis, from 0 to 10, by 1's, labeled time, hours. Vertical axis, from 0 to 100, by 20's, labeled caffeine, in milligrams. Line starts at 0 comma 100, passes through approximate points 2 comma 80, 5 comma 60, 9 comma 40, and Point P, 10 comma 35.\nImage description: <p>Graph of function.</p>\nA graph can also help us think about the values in the domain and range of a function. Because the body breaks down caffeine continuously over time, the domain of the function\u2014the time in hours\u2014can include non-whole numbers (for example, we can find the caffeine level when \\(t\\) is 3.5). In this situation, negative values for the domain would represent the time\u00a0before\u00a0the initial measurement. For example \\(f(\\text-1)\\) would represent the amount of caffeine in the person's body 1 hour before the initial measurement. The range of this function would not include negative values, as a negative amount of caffeine does not make sense in this situation."
