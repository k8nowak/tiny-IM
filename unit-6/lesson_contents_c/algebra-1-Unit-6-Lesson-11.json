    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students study the successive bounce heights of balls, model the relationship between the number of bounces and the bounce heights, and use that model to answer questions about the ball\u2019s bounciness. There are options for how much of the modeling cycle (MP4) students undertake. In one optional activity, students collect data for the bounce heights of different balls, while in two activities the data are provided. In all cases, the data are deliberately \u201cmessy\u201d to mirror data that students would gather through experimentation, and students are left to decide what kind of model to use. Though the data are not perfectly exponential or linear, an exponential model fits much better than a linear model does.\nOnce students decide to use an exponential model, they still have to find the parameters that best fit the data, while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy (MP6). Some may just use the quotient of the first two bounce heights, while others may look more closely at all of the bounce heights. As they compare and critique the different models, students construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others (MP3).\nTechnology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.",

The \\(y\\) values need to be selected carefully so that:\nData of interest shows up on the graph.\nInteresting trends (of increase or decrease) are as visible as possible.\nIf time permits, discuss:\n\u201cWhy does the graph show such a sharp decrease between \\(x\\) values of 0 and 2 and then start to flatten out?\u201d (The decay factor is 0.2, which means that whenever \\(x\\) increases by 1, it loses 0.8 of its quantity and keeps only 0.2. That decay is more apparent when the quantity is larger. As it gets smaller, and given the scale of the graph, it is harder to see the change. For example, when \\(x\\) increases from 0 to 1, \\(f(x)\\) decreases by 320, because \\((0.8) \\boldcdot 400=320\\). But when \\(x\\) increases from 2 to 3, \\(f(x)\\) decreases by\u00a0\\((0.8) \\boldcdot 16\\)\u00a0(or 10.8), which is a much smaller drop.)"

        "Activity Title": "Beholding Bounces",
        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students examine the successive heights that a tennis ball reaches after several bounces on a hard surface, and they consider how to model the relationship between the number of bounces and the height of the rebound. To do so, they need to determine the growth factor of successive bounce heights. Because some data is provided here, students engage in only some aspects of mathematical modeling. To engage students in the full modeling cycle that includes data gathering, consider asking students to measure the bounce heights\u00a0of a ball, as suggested in the next optional activity.\nReal-world data is often messy, and that is the case for the data provided here. While each successive bounce height is about half\u00a0of the preceding height, there is variation in the data, with the largest factor being a little more than 0.55 and the smallest a little less than 0.47.\nMonitor for students who:\nDecide that an exponential model is not appropriate because the growth factor is different from bounce to bounce.\nMake a rough approximation for the growth factor, for example, observe that each bounce height,\u00a0\\(h\\), is about half the preceding bounce height: \\(h = 150 \\boldcdot \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n\\).\nFind and use the growth factor from the first two points: \\(h = 150 \\boldcdot \\left( \\frac{8}{15} \\right)^n\\).\nTake an average of the successive quotients: \\(h = 150 \\boldcdot (0.53)^n\\).\nUse graphing technology to generate a regression equation: \\(h = 150.389 \\boldcdot (0.527)^n\\).\nHave students present in this order to support more precise methods for finding a model function to fit data.\nMaking graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",
        "Launch": "Arrange students in groups of 2\u20134.\u00a0\u00a0Select students with different strategies, such as those described in the Activity Narrative, and ask them\u00a0to share later.",
        "Student Task Statement": "Here are measurements for the maximum height of a tennis ball after bouncing several times on a concrete surface.\n\\(n\\), bounce number | \\(h\\), height (centimeters)\n0 | 150\n1 | 80\n2 | 43\n3 | 20\n4 | 11\nWhich is more appropriate for modeling the maximum height,\u00a0\\(h\\), in centimeters,\u00a0of the tennis ball after \\(n\\) bounces: a linear function or an exponential function? Use data from the table to support your answer.\nRegulations say that a tennis ball, dropped on concrete, should rebound to a height between 53% and 58% of the height from which it is\u00a0dropped. Does the tennis ball here meet this requirement? Explain your reasoning.\nWrite an equation\u00a0that models the bounce height,\u00a0\\(h\\), after \\(n\\) bounces for this tennis ball.\nAbout how many bounces will it take before the rebound height of the tennis ball is less than 1 centimeter? Explain your reasoning.",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Students may not be comfortable with the data not fitting an exponential function exactly. Remind them that real-world data is messy, so, when modeling, we must do our best to approximate the data. If an exponential model does a good job at approximating the data and showing its general trend, then this is a reasonable model to use even though it does not accurately predict or match all of the data.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite previously selected groups to share how they decided whether a linear or exponential model is more appropriate and how they found a model for the data. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.\nConnect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions such as:\n\u201cWhich methods for finding a model are more precise?\u201d (Doing calculations is more precise than estimating, and using technology to fit the data is even more accurate than that.)\n\u201cUse the different models to find the predicted height of the third bounce. How does it compare to the data?\u201d\n\u201cDo most of the data support the conclusion?\u201d\n\u201cHow can we explain the third bounce?\u201d (It is lower than predicted, but there could have been an error in measurement, or the tennis ball could have hit something on the floor.)\nTo follow up on the last question, consider discussing the practical domain in this context. Ask, for instance: \u201cHow long could we expect this behavior to continue? Can it go on indefinitely? What is a reasonable domain for our model?\u201d (Due to additional factors from physics like friction, the model will not fit for too many bounces. Probably after 4 or 5 bounces the model will get too far away from real-world data to be useful.)"

        "Activity Title": "Which Is the Bounciest of All?",
        "Activity Narrative": "This activity, designed for an extra class period, gives students an opportunity to gather and analyze data for bounce heights for multiple balls. Each ball should be sufficiently bouncy to allow measurement of at least 4 bounces. Good examples include\u00a0tennis balls, basketballs, super balls, golf balls, and soccer balls. It will also be important to find a surface that is hard, flat, and level. Any padding will dampen the bounces, and any slant or irregularity on the surface will affect the direction of the bounce. A tiled or concrete floor, or a flat and paved surface outdoors should work. Students will need measuring tapes and may need some practice gathering the data.\nNotice how students record the bounce heights. Recording these heights to the nearest inch or centimeter will already be challenging, and anything beyond that is too much precision. This activity is a good opportunity to choose a degree of precision appropriate to the context and to the measuring device used\u00a0(MP6).\nAs in the previous task, monitor for how students process their data and decide on an appropriate factor to quantify the bounciness of each ball. Students should now be comfortable with the fact that the data is not exactly exponential but may still choose different ways for deciding on an appropriate exponential decay factor.\nHere is a typical rebound factor for several types of balls:\nTennis ball: 0.5 to 0.6\nSuper ball: 0.9\nBasketball: about 0.6\nMaking graphing or spreadsheet technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",
        "Launch": "Arrange students in groups of 3 or 4. Give each group a measuring tape and a ball. Explain to students that their job is to determine the rebound factors of several balls by gathering data on their rebound heights. They then need to use mathematics to model the relationship between the number of bounces and the height of\u00a0a bounced ball.\nStudents should drop each ball from the same height. Consider letting students realize this on their own.",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Students may struggle to measure the heights of the bounces. Consider allowing phones or other technology that can record a video of the bounces so that it can be replayed in slow motion.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "If Ball 1 were dropped from a point that is twice as high, would its bounciness be greater, less, or the same? Explain your reasoning.\nBall 4 is half as bouncy as the least bouncy ball. What equation would describe its height \\(h\\)\u00a0in terms of the number of bounces \\(n\\)?\nBall 5 was dropped from a height of 150 centimeters. It bounced up very slightly once or twice and then began rolling. How would you describe its rebound factor? Explain your reasoning.",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Depending on available time, you may choose to have groups of students prepare a presentation for sharing their findings or simply discuss the data and findings as a whole class.\nAs in the previous task, highlight different methods for estimating the rebound factor (taking the quotient of two successive values, taking an average of successive quotients, or making a general estimate of successive quotients). Also highlight the inherent inaccuracy of bounce height measurements, which in turn influence how accurately we should report the successive quotients (MP6). Probably no more than one significant decimal digit should be used.\nFocus the discussion on the meaning of the rebound factors. Ask questions such as:\n\u201cDoes a larger factor mean\u00a0that the ball is more bouncy or less bouncy?\u201d\n\u201cDoes a larger factor mean that the heights are decreasing more quickly or more slowly?\u201d\nEmphasize the fact that in a situation modeled by a function,\u00a0\\(f\\), given by \\(f(n) = a \\boldcdot b^n\\), the number \\(b\\) expresses the growth factor. In situations where \\(0, a larger value of \\(b\\) means that the function decays more slowly (because more of the quantity remains). In terms of comparing the bounciness of the balls, the larger the successive quotients in the table columns, the bouncier the ball is. While all of the balls eventually will lie still on the ground, a larger successive quotient (or rebound factor) means that the bounce heights decrease more slowly."

    "Lesson Synthesis": "In this lesson, we explored models to represent successive bounce heights of different kinds of balls. The data we used were rather messy. Invite students to reflect on the process of modeling with such data.\n\u201cWas the data completely accurate? Why or why not?\u201d (Depending on the tools used, it can be very hard to get exact measurements of rebound heights, and it gets harder the lower the bounces are. Measurement errors are likely.)\n\u201cWe saw different rebound factors for different pairs of successive data points. How do we decide if an exponential model is still appropriate?\u201d (We might want to see if the differences are small enough to treat them as measurement error. In the lesson, they are all within about 0.05 of 0.5, and most of them are close to about 0.54.)\n\u201cGiven the inconsistency, how do we find an appropriate factor to use for our model?\u201d (We might disregard the factor(s) that are very different from the rest, or consider finding an average of the factors.)\nIf time permits, discuss possible limitations of our models. Ask questions such as:\n\u201cDo the models we produce work well after 45 bounces? After 78 bounces, or when the rebound height is less than 1 cm?\u201d\n\u201cCan we rely on the models to be appropriate if we bounce the ball on a different hard surface?\u201d\n\u201cWhat level of accuracy should we consider? For example, is 0.5 or 0.54 more appropriate for the rebound factor?\u201d",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "Sometimes data suggest an exponential relationship. For example, this table shows the bounce heights of a certain ball. We can see that the height decreases with each bounce.\nTo find out what fraction of the height remains after each bounce, we can divide two consecutive values: \\(\\frac{61}{95}\\) is about 0.642,\u00a0\\(\\frac{39}{61}\\) is about 0.639, and \\(\\frac{26}{39}\\) is about 0.667.\nAll of these quotients are close to \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). This suggests that we could model the relationship with an exponential function, and that the height is decreasing with a factor of about\u00a0\\(\\frac23\\) for each successive bounce.\nbounce number | bounce heightin centimeters\n1 | 95\n2 | 61\n3 | 39\n4 | 26\nThe height,\u00a0\\(h\\), of the ball, in cm, after \\(n\\) bounces can be modeled by the equation:\n\\(\\displaystyle h = 142 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{n}\\)\nHere is a graph of the equation.\nGraph of a function on grid, origin O. Horizontal axis, number of bounces, from 0 to 12, by 1's. Vertical axis, height in centimeters, from 0 to 150, by 25's. Line of given equation, h equals 142 time 2 thirds to the n, is graphed, passing through 0 comma 142, 1 comma 94 and two thirds, 2 comma 63 and 1 ninth. 3 comma 42 and 2 twenty-sevenths, 4 comma 28 and 4 eighty-firsts. Data points of 1 comma 95, 2 comma 61, 3 comma 39, 4 comma 26 also plotted.\nImage description: <p>Graph of function and data on grid.</p>\nThis graph shows both the points from the data and the points generated by the equation, which can give us new insights. For example, the height from which the ball was dropped is not given but can be determined. If \\(\\frac23\\) of the initial height is about 95 centimeters, then that initial height is about 142.5 centimeters, because \\(95 \\div \\frac23 = 142.5\\). For a second example, we can see that it will take 7 bounces before the rebound height is less than 10 centimeters."
