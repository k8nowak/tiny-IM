    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students start to view exponential relationships as exponential functions. This means choosing an independent and dependent variable and expressing the relationships using function language and, in some cases, function notation.\nFor an exponential relationship, either variable can be the independent variable but one choice gives an exponential function while the other gives a logarithmic function (which is outside the scope of this course). The contexts here are chosen and presented so\u00a0that it is more natural to choose an independent variable that leads to an exponential function.\u00a0If students select an independent variable that would lead to a logarithmic function, recognize that their choice is valid, but that the resulting function is not the focus of this unit and that they should consider the other variable as independent here.\nStudents use variables to represent one real-world quantity as a function of another, which is an example of decontextualizing and reasoning abstractly (MP2).",

        "Student Task Statement": "Here is a graph of the accumulated rainfall in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the first 60 days of 2017.\nLine graph titled, Accumulated Rainfall, Las Vegas, Nevada. Horizontal axis, day of the year 2017, from 0 to 60, by 10's. (There are 4 equally spaced hashmarks/tickmarks between each labeled number.) Vertical axis, rainfall in inches, from 0 to 1 point 6 by 0 point 2's.The graph begins at 0 comma 0 and moves horizontally and to the right until it reaches 11 comma 0. It then slants upward and to the right until it reaches 13 comma 0 point 1. The graph then moves horizontally and to the right until reaching 19 comma 0 point 1. It then slants upwards and to the right until it reaches 20 comma 0 point 4. The graph moves horizontally and to the right until reaching 21 comma 0 point 4. It then slants upwards and to the right until it reaches 22 comma 0 point 9. It slants upwards and to the right again until it reaches 23 comma 0 point 95. The graph then moves horizontally and to the right until reaching 41 comma 0 point 95. It slants upwards and to the right until 43 comma 1. It moves to horizontally and to the right until 47 comma 1. It slants upwards and to the right until 48 comma 1 point 02, and slants upwards and to the right again until 49 comma 1 point 45. The graph moves horizontally and to the right until 60 comma 1 point 45.\nImage description: <p>Graph, accumulated rainfall.</p>\nUse the graph to support your answers to the questions.\nIs the accumulated amount of rainfall a function of time?\nIs time a function of accumulated rainfall?",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "If students struggle to see from the graph how the accumulated rainfall is a function of time but time is not a function of accumulated rainfall, consider displaying the data in a table. Shown here is the data for the first 20 days of 2017. Help students see that for every value of \\(t\\), the time in days, there is one value of \\(r\\), the accumulated rainfall in inches, but this is not true the other way around.\n\\(t\\) (days) | \\(r\\) (inches)\n1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.03 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.11 | 0.38",

        "Activity Synthesis": "Make sure that students understand why the accumulated rain is a function of time but not the other way around.\nThen, recall the notation for writing, using function notation, accumulated rainfall as a function of time. If \\(r\\) represents the amount of rainfall in inches and \\(t\\) is time in days, then\u00a0\\(r(t)\\) is the amount of rain that has fallen in the first \\(t\\) days of 2017. For example, \\(r(2) = 0\\) tells us that the accumulated rainfall after in the first two days of the year was 0 inches. \\(r(48)=1\\) means that there was 1 inch of accumulated rain in the first 48 days of the year. Ask students to write and explain the meaning of a few other statements using function notation."

From the exponential equation, it is a short step to thinking of the relationship between the quantities as a function.\nNote that it is possible and acceptable to think of time as a function of area, but expressing this using an equation is out of the scope of this course. Students could, however, represent such a function with a graph, table, or description.\nMaking graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",

        "Student Task Statement": "Clare noticed mold on the last slice of bread in a plastic bag. The area covered by the mold was about 1 square millimeter. She left the bread alone to see how the mold would grow. The next day, the area covered by the mold had doubled, and it doubled again the day after that.\nIf the doubling pattern continues, how many square millimeters will the mold cover 4 days after she noticed the mold? Show your reasoning.\nRepresent the relationship between the area,\u00a0\\(A\\), in square millimeters, covered by the mold\u00a0and the number of days,\u00a0\\(d\\), since the mold was spotted using:\tA table of values, showing the values from the day the mold was spotted through 5 days later.An equationA graph\nA table of values, showing the values from the day the mold was spotted through 5 days later.\nAn equation\nA graph\nDiscuss with your partner: Is the relationship between the area covered by mold and the number of days a function? If so, write ____ is a function of ____. If not, explain why it is not.",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Students may have trouble understanding how to account for time in the first question. They may benefit from writing the area after 1 day has passed, 2 days have passed, and so on. A table is a convenient way to gather this information.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "What do you think an appropriate domain for the mold area function \\(A\\)\u00a0is? Explain your reasoning.",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Discuss why the area covered by mold is a function of the number of days that have passed. Attend explicitly to language that students learned in the prior unit on functions: The area of the mold,\u00a0\\(A\\), is a function of the number of days,\u00a0\\(d\\), since the mold was spotted, \\(A = f(d)\\). The function,\u00a0\\(f\\), expressing the mold relationship can be written as\u00a0\\(f(d) = 1 \\boldcdot 2^d\\), where \\(d\\) measures days since the mold was spotted, and \\(f(d)\\) gives the area covered by the mold in square millimeters.\nDiscuss whether a discrete graph or a curve is more appropriate and what domain would be suitable in this context. Ask questions such as:\n\u201cCan the independent variable be something like 1.5, a number that is not a whole number? Is there an area that is associated with 1.5 days?\u201d (Yes, some area of the bread is covered by mold at any point in time after \\(t=0\\). The mold doesn't disappear after being spotted and then reappear at exactly 1 full day, 2 full days, and so on.)\n\u201cWhat would be the meaning of a point on the graph where the value of\u00a0\\(d\\) is, for instance, between 2 and 3?\u201d (It would mean the area covered by mold at some point more than 2 days but less than 3 days after mold was spotted.)\n\u201cWhat domain would be appropriate for this function? Can the mold grow indefinitely?\u201d (Since the area of the bread (the range) is limited, the exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. By the end of one week, more than 1 square cm will be covered and, by the end of the second week, the values of the function will be close to or will exceed the total area of the bread.)\nStudents using paper and pencil may decide that it makes sense to connect the points on the graph but they will not yet know how to do so. Consider stating that they are connected (in a very specific way) and that their properties will be studied later.\nStudents using the digital version (or graphing technology along with the paper and pencil version) will see the continuous graph. If desired, you may want to demonstrate how using function notation to write the equation like \\(f(d) = 1 \\boldcdot 2^d\\) can be put to use. Try typing \\(A(2)\\) or \\(A(\\text-1)\\)."

        "Activity Narrative": "Students have described and analyzed situations involving exponential change, using graphs, tables, and equations. Now they revisit several of these contexts, viewing them as functions and expressing them using function language and notation.\nEach situation involves two quantities, and students will need to choose one of these to be the independent variable and one to be the dependent variable. For all of these relationships, it is possible to choose either variable as the independent variable, but one choice gives a logarithmic function (which is out of the scope of this course), while the other gives an exponential function. In each case, however, students have previously worked with the context.\nLook for students who explicitly state the meaning of their variables, including units, and invite them to share during the discussion. For example, in the second situation, if \\(t\\) represents the number of years and \\(v\\) represents the value of the car, in dollars, after \\(t\\) years, then \\(v\\) can be viewed as a function,\u00a0\\(f\\), of \\(t\\), where\u00a0\\(f(t) = 18,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^t\\). The meaning and units for both \\(t\\) and \\(f(t)\\) (or \\(v\\)) are vital elements to answering the question fully (MP6).",

Every hour, on the hour, each bacterium splits into two bacteria.\nEvery year after a new car is purchased, it loses \\(\\frac13\\) of its value. Let\u2019s say that the new car costs \\$18,000.\nIn order to control an algae bloom in a lake, scientists introduce some treatment products. The day they begin treatment, the area covered by algae is 240 square yards. Each day since the treatment began, a third of the previous day\u2019s area (in square yards) remains covered by algae. Time,\u00a0\\(t\\), is measured in days.",

The equation gives the area covered by the algae at each time,\u00a0\\(t\\), so a function,\u00a0\\(f\\), can be defined using the same expression: \\(f(t) =240 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^t\\), and \\(A = f(t)\\)."

        "Activity Narrative": "This optional activity further addresses the skill of choosing an appropriate graphing window when using graphing technology. In an earlier activity, students looked at how adjusting the graphing window affects the usefulness of the graph. Here they gauge the reasonableness of a graphing window given an equation and a description of a function.\nBecause exponential functions eventually grow very quickly, the graph tends to quickly go off the screen if the domain is too large. The graphing window can be adjusted to display large values for the vertical axis, but in doing so, the output values for most of the domain will all look like they are essentially 0.\nTo decide on the reasonableness of the given graphing boundaries, students may evaluate the function at the endpoints of the domain for the graphing window. Look for students who think carefully about the domain, observing that, based on the context, the equation probably does not model even modest negative values of the input variable. This activity represents scaffolded practice for an important aspect of mathematical modeling (MP4).",

Explain your reasoning.\\(\\displaystyle \\text-10< h<100\\)\\(\\displaystyle \\text-100< m<1,000\\)\nVerify your answer by graphing the equation using graphing technology, and using the given graphing window. What do you see? Sketch or describe the graph.\nIf your graph in the previous question is unhelpful, modify the window settings so that the graph is more useful. Record the window settings here.

Or display the graphs in the sample responses for all to see. Discuss questions such as:\n\u201cWhy were the given boundaries not good?\u201d (The domain and range are both too wide. The range is so large that almost all the points look like they're about 0. It is even hard to tell what the starting value is.)\n\u201cHow can the context help us choose an appropriate graphing window?\u201d (Negative values of time probably are not relevant because the amount of medicine in the body before the injection is likely insignificant or is not modeled by the equation. Large values of time (say \\(t=100\\)) are not likely important because the effects of the medicine after 100 hours are likely to be minimal.)\nGraphing exponential functions can be challenging because they can increase or decrease very quickly. Emphasize that an appropriate graphing window can often be selected by using the context. Once the relevant domain of a function and the horizontal boundaries of a graph are chosen, the vertical boundaries can be selected based on the output values for that domain so that any meaningful trends (for example, exponential decay) are visible."

Both equations can be used to produce a table or graph or to answer questions about the bacteria\u00a0population. The notation \\(p = f(t)\\) makes explicit that \\(p\\) depends on \\(t\\).)\n\u201cHow are the exponential functions here like or different from linear functions we saw earlier in the course?\u201d (Both functions represent relationships where one quantity is determined by another quantity, and there is only one possible output for every input. They are different in that linear functions grow by addition, and exponential functions grow by multiplication.)",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "The situations we have looked at that are characterized by exponential change can be seen as\u00a0functions. In each situation, there is a quantity\u2014an independent variable\u2014that determines another quantity\u2014a dependent variable. They are functions because any value of the independent variable that makes sense corresponds to only one value of the dependent variable.\u00a0Functions that describe exponential change are called exponential functions.\nFor example, suppose \\(t\\) represents time in hours, and \\(p\\) is a bacteria population \\(t\\) hours after the bacteria population was measured. For each time \\(t\\), there is only one value for the corresponding number of bacteria, so we can say that \\(p\\) is a function of \\(t\\)\u00a0and we can write this as \\(p = f(t)\\).\nIf there were 100,000 bacteria at the time it was initially measured and the population decreases so that \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\) of it remains after each passing hour, we can use function notation to model the bacteria population:\n\\(\\displaystyle f(t) = 100,\\!000 \\boldcdot \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^t\\)\nNotice the expression in the form of \\(a \\boldcdot b^t\\) (on the right side of the equation) is the same as in previous equations that we wrote to represent situations characterized by exponential change."
