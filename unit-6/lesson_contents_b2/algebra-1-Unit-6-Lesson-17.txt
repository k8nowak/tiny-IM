## Lesson Narrative
"""
In this lesson, students apply what they have learned about compound interest to critically examine different situations. First, they look at how credit card companies often report interest rates (nominal annual percentage rate), versus how much interest a cardholder actually pays over the course of a year on an unpaid balance (effective annual percentage rate). The effective rate is higher than the nominal rate because of the effect of compounded interest.
Next, students are asked to choose the better of two investment options with different interest rates and compounding intervals. Finally, an optional activity looks at the rising costs of college tuition and compares the rates of increase over different decades.
Throughout this lesson, students strategically write expressions, compare them, and relate them back to monetary contexts (MP2).
"""
## Learning Goals
Compare interest rates and compounding intervals to choose the better investment option.
Calculate the result of repeated percent increase for the same initial balance and interest rate, but compounded at different intervals.
## Student-Facing Goal
Let's find out what happens when we repeatedly apply the same percent increase at different intervals of time.
## Student-Facing Targets
I can calculate interest when I know the starting balance, interest rate, and compounding intervals.
When given interest rates and compounding intervals, I can choose the better investment option.

\$1,000 is deposited into a bank account that earns 1% interest each month. Each month, the interest is added to the account, and no other deposits or withdrawals are made.

Why do Elena's expression and Tyler's expression both represent the account balance correctly?

### Activity Synthesis
"""
Invite groups to share their explanations for why Tyler's and Elena's expressions both represent the account balance after 3 years. If not already mentioned in students explanations, highlight the following:
In Elena's expression, \((1.01)^{36}\) correctly represents the 1% interest applied or compounded every month for 36 months, which is 3 years.
In Tyler's expression, \((1.01)^{12}\) represents the 1% interest compounded every month for 12 months or a year. So for 3 years, we need to multiply the initial balance by that yearly rate 3 times, or \((1.01)^{12} \boldcdot(1.01)^{12} \boldcdot(1.01)^{12}\), which is equivalent to\(\left((1.01)^{12}\right)^3\).
By the power of powers property, we also know that \(\left((1.01)^{12}\right)^3 =(1.01)^{36}\).
(If time permits:) Evaluating \((1.01)^{12}\) gives approximately 1.1268. This means that 12.68 is the effective annual rate, which is the rate that Kiran used in his expression.

Contemplating Credit Cards
### Activity Narrative
"""
Building on their work in the Warm-up, students make several compound-interest calculations in a credit card context. They revisit and explore how nominal and effective interest rates are used by credit institutions.
In a borrowing context, the nominal annual percentage rate, or the nominal APR, is 12 times the monthly interest rate. The effective annual percentage rate is the compounded interest rate if no payments are made over a year. As in other compounding situations, the nominal APR is lower than the effective annual rate (the actual rate cardholders pay). For this reason, credit card companies usually report the nominal APR rather than the effective annual rate to make the card more appealing.
Students also practice writing different expressions to represent the same quantity in an exponential situation. Look for these variations in students' work, and ask them to share later:
\(1,\!000 \boldcdot \left((1.02)^{12}\right)^t\)
\(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.02)^{12t}\)
about \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.268)^3\)

Display the Math Community Chart for all to see. Give students a brief quiet think time to read the norms or invite a student to read them out loud. Tell them that during this activity they are going to choose a norm to focus on and practice. This norm should be one that they think will help themselves and their group during the activity. At the end of the activity, students can share what norm they chose and how the norm did or did not support their group.
Give students an overview of credit cards, in case students are unfamiliar. Consider using the explanation: Credit card companies allow their clients (the cardholders) to borrow money. In return, the companies charge interest, a percentage of the borrowed amount, until the debt is paid. The percentage charged every year is called the annual percentage rate (APR). The companies allow their card holders to pay incrementally, by making a certain minimum amount of payment every month. Interest is charged on the remaining owed amount (the balance). Many companies charge late fees if the minimum payment is not made.
Students will have seen the terms nominal interest rate and effective interest rate from a previous lesson. Remind them as needed.
Use Co-Craft Questions to orient students to the context and to elicit possible mathematical questions.
Display only the problem stem and related image, without revealing the questions. Give students 1–2 minutes to write a list of mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation, before comparing questions with a partner.

Select previously identified students to share their expressions for the account balance after \(t\) years. Discuss questions such as:
“Are all of these expressions equivalent? How do you know?” (Make sure students understand that \(1,\!000 \boldcdot \left(1.02^{12}\right)^t\) and \(1,\!000 \boldcdot \left(1.02^{12t}\right)\) are equivalent, but that \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.268)^t\) is a convenient approximation for the other two.)
“Why do you think the credit card company advertises the nominal annual percentage rate rather than the effective annual percentage rate?” (The nominal APR of 24% sounds better because it is less than the effective annual rate of 26.8%. Credit card companies choose the percentage rate so that it works to their advantage. Banks advertise the effective annual percentage for their interest-bearing accounts for the same reason.)

Which One Would You Choose?
### Activity Narrative
"""
This task prompts students to build mathematical models to compare two different interest options. Along the way, they need to make assumptions, most notably about the length of the investment because the better investment option may depend on what they assume to be true.
The given rates and compounding intervals are chosen so that it is not clear how the investments would pay for an investment time that is not a multiple of the compounding interval. For example, if the investment is left for 9 months, the option that compounds interest every 3 months will make 3 payouts, but what about the option that compounds interest every 4 months? Students might assume that each method pays only at the end of the compounding interval. In that event, the option that compounds interest every 4 months would pay interest only twice.
Notice how students deal with the length of the investment. Some students may recognize the structural similarity between the situation here and that in the previous activity (that a 1% monthly rate leads to a higher interest than a 12% annual rate does) and reason accordingly.
In asking "What if?" questions, stating their assumptions, and applying what they know about exponential growth to solve a real-world problem, students are engaging in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4). While the investment context is authentic and practical, the rates in this task are theoretical, because they are chosen to enable students to find and compare effective annual rates.

"""
### Activity Synthesis
"""
Invite students to share their choice and their rationales. Discuss questions such as:
"What is the nominal annual interest rate for each option?" (12%. There are four quarters or four 3-month periods in a year, so the nominal annual rate is 4 times 3%, or 12%. There are three 4-month periods in a year, so the nominal annual rate is 3 times 4%, or 12%).
"Do they have the same effective annual rate? Why or why not?" (No, because the periodic interest is not calculated with the same frequency.)
"How does the length of investments influence your calculations and investment choice?" (Because the interest is given on only certain months, the balances jump up at certain times rather than changing smoothly. This means that if I’m planning to take out the money at a certain time, I need to choose the better option based on how long the money has been invested.)
"Will the 4% investment option ever be the better option? When?" (It would be the preferred option if the investment option is, say, 4 months or 8 months.)
Option 2 will be favorable for a length of investment that is a multiple of 4 months but not a multiple of 3 months, up until a certain time, at which point the shorter compounding period in Option 1 will always present an advantage over the higher rate in Option 2. The extension problem prompts students to think about whether the exact length of investment would continue to matter, or whether one option would always outperform the other for some domain.

Changes over the Years
### Activity Narrative
"""
In this activity, students interpret an exponential equation in context. The equation describes college tuition cost as a function of time in years. Students are invited to examine how the tuition changes each decade.
Along the way, students observe that the rate of change is the same for any decade and that the time it takes tuition cost to double remains consistent. (If desired, this may be an opportunity to introduce the Rule of 72, a method for estimating the doubling time of a quantity that grows exponentially. In an earlier lesson, when comparing the graphs of the owed amounts at 12%, 24%, and 30% interest rates, students made estimates of when each loan would double. If the Rule of 72 is introduced, consider referring back to that activity to test the rule.)  Students may also notice that the current rate of growth for tuition is likely unsustainable.
For the second question, students may reason inductively (by evaluating the expressions for certain 10-year periods) or deductively (by using the structure of the expressions and properties of exponents). Identify students who use each approach so they can share later.

Highlight the fact that every year the tuition grows by a factor of \(1.07\), and so every two years it will grow by a factor of \((1.07)^2\), and every ten years it will grow by a factor of \((1.07)^{10}\). In this context, 10-year periods are convenient because \(1.07^{10} \approx 1.97\). So approximately every 10 years, the tuition doubles.
Ask students by what factor the tuition will grow between 2017 and 2037, assuming this trend continues. In thousands of dollars, it would be \(15 \boldcdot (1.07)^{20}\), or (because 20 years is 2 decades) \(15 \boldcdot \left((1.07)^{10}\right)^2\). Because \((1.07)^{10} \approx 2\), this means that in 2037 the tuition would be about \$60,000! Another way to see this is that from 2017 to 2027 the tuition will double to \$30,000, and then from 2027 to 2037 it doubles again to \$60,000.

We looked at how to calculate account balances when the interest is calculated at different time intervals. Review how compounding intervals affect the quantity being studied, and how to represent the different patterns of increase using expressions.
Let's say you have \$1,000 in a bank account that pays 8% annual interest and you make no other deposits or withdrawals.
"Which of these options for calculating interest would you prefer: 8% calculated at the end of one year, 4% calculated every half a year, 2% calculated every quarter (or 3 months), or \(\frac{8}{12}\)% calculated every month? Why?" (I would prefer the monthly option because I will have more times when interest is calculated on interest and that would result in a greater total at the end of a year. It also means I could withdraw my money sooner if I needed and still have some interest added.)
"For each option, what expression would you write to represent the balance in the account after one year?" (Yearly: \(1000 \boldcdot 1.08\). Half-year: \(1000 \boldcdot (1.04)^2\). Quarterly: \(1000 \boldcdot (1.02)^4\). Monthly: \(1000 \boldcdot \left( \frac{8}{12} \right)^{12}\).)
"If the bank calculates 1/12 of the interest every month, will you have 8% of \$1,000 (or \$80) after one year? Why or why not?" (No, there will be more than that because each month the new interest is calculated using the original amount as well as the interest from all the previous months.)
"""
## Student Lesson Summary
"""
In many situations, interest is calculated more frequently than once a year. How often the interest is compounded and calculated and added to the previous amount affects the overall amount of interest earned (or owed) over time.
Suppose a bank account has a balance of \$1,000 and a nominal annual interest rate of 6% per year. No additional deposits or withdrawals are made.
If the bank compounds interest annually, the account will have one interest calculation in one year, at a 6% rate. If it compounds interest every 6 months, the account will see two interest calculations in one year, at a 3% rate each time (because \(6 \div 2 = 3\)). If it is compounded every 3 months, there will be 4 calculations at 1.5% each time, and so on.
This table shows the nominal interest rates used for different compounding intervals, as well as the corresponding expressions for the account balance in one year.
compoundinginterval | compoundingfrequency per year | nominal interest rate | account balance in one year
annually (12 months) | 1 time | 6% | \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1+0.06)\)
semi-annually (6 months) | 2 times | 3% | \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1+0.03)^2\)
quarterly (3 months) | 4 times | 1.5% | \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1+0.015)^4\)
monthly (1 month) | 12 times | 0.5% | \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1+0.005)^{12}\)
If we evaluate the expressions, we find these account balances:
annually: \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.06) = 1,\!060\)
semi-annually: \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.03)^2 = 1,\!060.90\)
quarterly: \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.015)^4 \approx 1,\!061.36\)
monthly: \(1,\!000 \boldcdot (1.005)^{12} \approx 1,\!061.68\)
Notice that the more frequently interest is calculated, the greater the balance is.
