Warm-Up: Back to the Post!
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Here are the graphs of some situations you saw before. Each graph represents the distance of a dog from a post as a function of time since the dog owner left to purchase something from a store. Distance is measured in feet, and time is measured in seconds. Day 1 Image description: <p>Nonlinear function. time in seconds and distance from post in feet.<br> </p> Day 2 Image description: <p>Nonlinear function. time in seconds and distance from post in feet.</p> Day 3 Use the given graphs to answer these questions about each of the three days:How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3:How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3:The owner returned 160 seconds after he left. How far away was the dog from the post at that time?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3:How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point from the post it could reach?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: Use the given graphs to answer these questions about each of the three days: How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: The owner returned 160 seconds after he left. How far away was the dog from the post at that time?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: The owner returned 160 seconds after he left. How far away was the dog from the post at that time? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point from the post it could reach?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point from the post it could reach? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: Consider the statement, “The dog was 2 feet away from the post after 80 seconds.” Do you agree with the statement? What was the distance of the dog from the post 100 seconds after the owner left?

Takeaway:
Understand the importance of clear and specific notation in communicating about functions.

Steps:
1. Display three graphs representing a dog’s distance from a post over time.
2. Have students interpret the graphs and answer specific questions for each day (e.g., distance after 60 seconds, distance when the owner left, etc.).
3. Encourage students to identify if their answers refer to one function or all three.
4. Facilitate a whole-class discussion to clarify responses and the need for specificity in communicating about functions.
5. Emphasize that precise language is necessary to avoid ambiguity when discussing functions.


Activity 1: A Handy Notation
Timing: 15 minutes

Task Statement:
Let’s name the functions that relate the dog’s distance from the post and the time since its owner left: function \(f\) for Day 1, function \(g\) for Day 2, function \(h\) for Day 3. The input of each function is time in seconds, \(t\). Use function notation to complete the table.	day 1day 2day 3a. distance from post 60 seconds after the owner leftb. distance from post when the owner leftc. distance from post 160 seconds after the owner left | day 1 | day 2 | day 3 a. distance from post 60 seconds after the owner left |  |  | b. distance from post when the owner left |  |  | c. distance from post 160 seconds after the owner left |  |  | Describe what each expression represents in this context:\(f(15)\)\(g(48)\)\(h(t)\) Describe what each expression represents in this context: \(f(15)\) \(g(48)\) \(h(t)\) The equation \(g(120) = 4\) can be interpreted to mean: “On Day 2, 120 seconds after the dog owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.” What does each equation mean in this situation?\(h(40) = 4.6\)\(f(t) = 5\)\(g(t) = d\) The equation \(g(120) = 4\) can be interpreted to mean: “On Day 2, 120 seconds after the dog owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.” What does each equation mean in this situation? \(h(40) = 4.6\) \(f(t) = 5\) \(g(t) = d\)

Takeaway:
Understand and apply function notation to communicate about functions and their outputs.

Steps:
1. Explain function notation and the problem context using the dog’s distance.
2. Display a sample written response for critique; guide students to identify unclear parts.
3. Partner up for 2-4 minutes to revise the draft based on given criteria.
4. Select individuals/groups to share revisions aloud; scribe their responses on the board.
5. Invite class to collaboratively edit and clarify final drafts.
6. Discuss how to interpret and read function notation aloud.


Activity 2: Birthdays
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Rule \(B\) takes a person’s name as its input and gives their birthday as the output. input | output Abraham Lincoln | February 12 | | | Rule \(P\) takes a date as its input and gives a person with that birthday as the output. input | output August 26 | Katherine Johnson | | | Complete each table with three more examples of input-output pairs. If you use your name as the input to \(B\), how many outputs are possible? Explain how you know. If you use your birthday as the input to \(P\), how many outputs are possible? Explain how you know. Only one of the two relationships is a function. The other is not a function. Which one is which? Explain how you know. For the relationship that is a function, write two input-output pairs from the table using function notation.

Takeaway:
"Determine and express whether a relationship is a function based on unique input-output pairing."

Steps:
1. Arrange pairs of students.
2. Each student completes input-output tables for rules \\(B\\) and \\(P\\) with three examples.
3. Discuss the uniqueness of outputs: Analyze “How many outputs are possible for your name in \\(B\\)?” and “For your birthday in \\(P\\)?”
4. Determine which rule is a function and justify reasons.
5. Write two input-output pairs from \\(B\\) using function notation.
6. Synthesize: Discuss why \\(B\\) is a function and \\(P\\) is not, referencing unique outputs.
7. Analyze bagel shop function notation statements in pairs, identifying inputs, outputs, and meanings.
