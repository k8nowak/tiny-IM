# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
In this lesson, students build on their understanding of linear inequalities in two variables to find the solutions to systems of linear inequalities in two variables.
Students learn that two linear inequalities that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of inequalities, and that the solutions to the system include all numbers that satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Graphically, the solution set of the system is represented by the region where the graphs of the individual inequalities overlap.
Throughout the lesson, students endeavor to find values that satisfy multiple constraints, both in terms of a situation and in the absence of one. The process requires that students make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1) and that students reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).
"""
## Learning Goals
Write systems of inequalities in two variables, use technology to graph the solutions, and interpret the solutions in context.
Understand that the solution set of a system of inequalities in two variables is composed of any pair of values that make both inequalities true, and that it is represented graphically by the region where the graphs overlap.
Given descriptions and graphs that represent two constraints, identify values that satisfy each constraint and those that satisfy both constraints simultaneously.
## Student-Facing Goal
Let’s look at situations in which two constraints (that can be expressed by inequalities) must be met simultaneously.
## Student-Facing Targets
I can write a system of inequalities to describe a situation, find the solution by graphing, and interpret points in the solution.
I know what is meant by "the solutions to a system of inequalities" and can describe the graphs that represent the solutions.
When given descriptions and graphs that represent two different constraints, I can find values that satisfy each constraint individually, and values that satisfy both constraints at once.

The given system has a solution that is hard to find mentally, but can be calculated algebraically or by using graphing technology.
Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).

"What constraints do the two equations represent?" (The first equation represents a constraint about the sum of the two numbers. The second represents a constraint about the difference of the two numbers.)
"What does a solution to the system represent?" (The solution is a pair of numbers that simultaneously meets both constraints, or makes both equations true.)
"How many pairs of numbers meet both constraints at the same time?" (Only one pair. The graphs of the equations intersect at one point.)

A Quilting Project
### Activity Narrative
"""
In this activity, students encounter a situation in which two constraints that can be expressed with inequalities are represented on two separate graphs, which makes it challenging to find pairs of values that meet both constraints simultaneously. This motivates a desire to represent both constraints on the same graph.
As students work, monitor for the different ways in which they try to find a pair of values that satisfy both inequalities. Some likely approaches:
Substituting different \(x\)- and \(y\)-values into the inequalities until they find a pair that makes both inequalities true.
Visually estimating a point in the solution region of one graph that appears likely to also be in the solution region of the other graph (for example, noticing that \((6,4)\) is in the solution region of each inequality.
Graphing both inequalities on the same coordinate plane (either by using technology or by copying the line in one graph onto the other graph) and finding a point in the region where they overlap.
Identify students who use these or other approaches, and ask them to share during class discussion.
Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).

### Launch
"""
Give students a moment to read the task statement and to look at the two graphs. Ask students:
“Do you or your family have a quilt? Is there a story about why that quilt is important to you? Do the shapes or patterns have an important meaning?”
“What are the two constraints in this situation?” (A length constraint and a cost constraint)
“Which graph represents which constraint? How do you know?” (The first graph represents the length constraint. Possible explanations:	The graph intersects the vertical and horizontal axes at approximately 9.5, which means that if the quilter bought 0 yards of one color, he will need at least 9.5 yards of the other color.The length constraint says "at least 9.5 yards," so the lengths must include values greater than 9.5, which is shown by the shaded region of the first graph.The second graph represents the cost constraint. If the quilter bought 0 yards of the light color, he could buy up to \(\frac{110}{13}\), or about 8.5, yards of the dark color fabric. This corresponds to the vertical intercept of the second graph.) The cost constraint says "up to \$110," so the lengths must be below certain limits. The solution region of the second graph shows values below a boundary.)

Consider selecting first one inequality, then the other, and then both simultaneously.
(The Desmos graphs show both variables being restricted to positive values, but students are not expected to do this when graphing. Consider discussing with students why it makes sense in this situation to disregard negative values.)
Discuss the meaning of a pair of values that satisfies both inequalities. Emphasize that, in this situation, it refers to the amount of fabric of each color that meets both the length and cost requirements.

In a system of equations, the solutions can be represented by one or more points where the graphs of the equations intersect.

Here are some situations that you have seen before. Answer the questions for one situation.
Club Donations
A school environmental club is raising money during the year to donate in support of two causes: a national organization lobbying for clean air and a local non-profit working to restore a stream that runs past the school. They plan to donate a maximum of $600 by the end of the year, some toward clean air and some toward stream restoration.
When the restoration of the stream is complete, the name of any person or group that donated $500 or more will be added to a commemorative plaque. The national organization lobbying for clean air does not offer any donation perks.
Concert Tickets
Two kinds of tickets to an outdoor concert were sold: lawn tickets and seat tickets. Fewer than 400 tickets in total were sold.
Lawn tickets cost \$30 each and seat tickets cost \$50 each. The organizers want to make at least $14,000 from ticket sales.
Advertising Packages
An advertising agency offers two packages for small businesses who need advertising services. A basic package includes only design services. A premium package includes design and promotion. The agency's goal is to sell at least 60 packages in total.
The basic advertising package has a value of \$1,000 and the premium package has a value of \$2,500. The goal of the agency is to sell more than $60,000 worth of small-business advertising packages.

Much of the discussion would have happened in small groups. During the whole-class discussion, emphasize the meaning of a point in the region where two graphs of linear inequalities overlap. Make sure students understand that all the points in that region represent values that simultaneously meet both constraints in the situation.
If time permits, ask students, "Why does it make sense to think of the two inequalities in each situation as a system and find the solutions to the system, instead of only to individual inequalities?" (If both constraints in the situation must be met, then we need to find values that satisfy both inequalities.)

"How can we tell the number of solutions from each set of graphs?" (The graphs representing a system of equations show one point of intersection, so there is only one solution. The graphs representing a system of inequalities show one region of overlap, but there are many points in that region. This means that there are many solutions.)
"""
## Student Lesson Summary
"""
In this lesson, two linear inequalities in two variables represent the constraints in a situation. Each pair of inequalities forms a system of inequalities.
A solution to a system of inequalities is any \((x,y)\) pair that makes both inequalities true, or any pair of values that simultaneously meet both constraints in the situation. The solution to the system is often best represented by a region on a graph.
Suppose there are two numbers, \(x\) and \(y\), and there are two things we know about them.
The value of one number is more than double the value of the other.
The sum of the two numbers is less than 10.
We can represent these constraints with a system of inequalities.
\(\begin {cases} y > 2x\\ x+y <10 \end {cases}\)
There are many possible pairs of numbers that meet the first constraint, for example: 1 and 3, or 4 and 9.
The same can be said about the second constraint, for example: 1 and 3, or 2.4 and 7.5.
The pair \(x=1\) and \(y=3\) meets both constraints, so it is a solution to the system.
The pair \(x=4\) and \(y=9\) meets the first constraint but not the second (\(9 >2(4)\) is a true statement, but \(4+9<10\) is not true.)
Remember that graphing is a great way to show all the possible solutions to an inequality, so let’s graph the solution region for each inequality.​​​​​​
A graph of an inequality on a coordinate plane, origin O. Each axis from negative 10 to 5, by 5’s. Dashed line starts below x axis and right of y axis, goes through negative 2 point 5 comma negative 5, 0 comma 0, and 2 point 5 comma 5. The region above the dashed line is shaded.

Because we are looking for a pair of numbers that meet both constraints or make both inequalities true at the same time, we want to find points that are in the solution regions of both graphs.
To do that, we can graph both inequalities on the same coordinate plane.
The solution set to the system of inequalities is represented by the region where the two graphs overlap.
