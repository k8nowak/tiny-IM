    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students deepen their understanding of the solutions to linear inequalities by studying them in context. They write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints,\u00a0and interpret the points on a boundary line and on\u00a0either side of it in terms of the situation.\nInterpreting the solutions contextually\u00a0also engages students in an aspect of mathematical modeling (MP4). It\u00a0enables students to see that, while some values might make an inequality true,\u00a0they might not be feasible or appropriate\u00a0in the situation. There\u00a0is an opportunity to make a generalization based on repeated reasoning (MP8)\u00a0when students first find numbers that meet a constraint, and then use variables in place of those numbers to write an equation and an inequality.\nBecause reasoning about the solution region of\u00a0an inequality is important here, graphing technology should not be used. Students will have opportunities to use graphing technology to solve inequalities in two variables in upcoming lessons.",

Both points mean a total of 150 square feet of landscape materials.

It might also make a difference to the plants and to the overall appearance\u00a0of the yard.)\n\u201cAll the points in the shaded region represent amounts of gravel and turf that are within the homeowner's budget. Are all these options equally good and desirable?\" (Most likely\u00a0not. For example, if the homeowner needs both materials, pairs such as \\((0,100)\\) or \\((450,0)\\) are probably not desirable because they mean buying only one material but not the other. The point \\((0,0)\\) is also in the solution region, but buying no materials is probably also not an option because it would not help the homeowner with her landscaping goals.)"

Here, they see another reason that some values that satisfy an inequality might be unfeasible in the situation\u2014namely, that the pair of values must be whole numbers.

Ask students why each one might be an appropriate representation of the solutions to the inequality.\nHighlight that the discrete points represent the situation more accurately, because it is impossible to sell a fraction of a bracelet or 2.75 necklaces. It is, however, tedious to plot a bunch of points to show the solution region. It is much easier to shade the entire region, but with the understanding that, in this situation, only whole-number values make sense as solutions."

Artificial turf, square feet. Gravel, square feet.</p>\n\\(9n+5b>100\\)\nImage description: <p>Graph of an inequality. Number of bracelets. Number of necklaces.</p>\nAsk students to compare\u00a0the solution regions and think about what they tell us about the constraints of the\u00a0situation they represent. Discuss questions such as:\n\"How are the\u00a0solution regions of the two inequalities alike?\" (Each region represents all pairs of values that meet a money-related constraint\u00a0in a situation. They cover a part of the plane. They stop at a line.)\n\"How do we know where the boundary line would be for each graph?\" (It is the graph of a related equation.)\n\"For each inequality, how did we find out which side of the line contains the solutions?\" (We tested one or more pairs of values on each side and saw if\u2014when substituted for the variables\u2014they made the inequality true.)\n\"In the first situation, some pairs of values that are in the solution region\u00a0don't make sense in the situation. Can you explain why a pair such as \\((800, 1)\\), which is in the solution region, might not be a reasonable option for the homeowner?\" (It doesn't quite make sense to cover 1 square foot of the garden with artificial turf and the rest with gravel. The area of the garden might be a lot greater or a lot less than 801 square feet.)\n\"In the second situation, we know that fractional values are not meaningful\u00a0even though they are in the shaded region. Can you think of other reasons that some\u00a0points in the solution region might not make sense?\" (A point like \\((100, 100)\\) would be in the solution region, but the vendor might not have that many items to sell.)\nSome students may point out that it is possible to reason about the side that contains the solutions by reasoning about each context. In these particular examples, this can be done intuitively and correctly. When the boundary line represents\u00a0the cost of two quantities exactly on budget, smaller values of each quantity would lead to costs that are below the budget. When the boundary line represents a profit of \\$100 from selling two kinds of products, a greater number of each product would mean a greater profit.\nEmphasize, however, that it is not always the case that the solution region could be reasoned easily or correctly from the context, so it is always a good idea to verify using another method. The optional activity (\"Charity Concert\") illustrates this point.",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "Inequalities in two variables can represent constraints in real-life situations. Graphing their solutions can enable us to solve problems.\nSuppose a caf\u00e9 is purchasing coffee and tea from a supplier and can spend up to \\$1,000. Coffee beans cost \\$12 per kilogram, and tea leaves cost\u00a0\\$8 per kilogram.\nBuying \\(c\\) kilograms of coffee beans and \\(t\\) kilograms of tea leaves will therefore cost \\(12c + 8t\\). To represent the budget constraints, we can write: \\(12c + 8t \\leq 1,\\!000\\).\nThe solution to this inequality is any pair of \\(c\\) and \\(t\\) that makes the inequality true. In this situation, it is any combination of the kilograms of coffee and tea that the caf\u00e9 can order without going over the \\$1,000 budget.\nWe can try different pairs of \\(c\\) and \\(t\\) to see what combinations satisfy the constraint, but it would be difficult to capture all the possible combinations this way. Instead, we can graph a related equation,\u00a0\\(12c+8t = 1,\\!000\\), and then find out which region represents all possible solutions.\nHere is the graph of that equation.\nTo determine the solution region,\u00a0let\u2019s take one point on the line\u00a0and one point on each side of the line, and see if the pairs of values produce true statements.\nA point on the line:\u00a0\\((30,80)\\)\n\\(\\begin {align}12(30) + 8(80) \\leq 1,\\!000\\\\ 360 + 640 \\leq 1,\\!000\\\\ 1,\\!000\\leq 1,\\!000 \\end {align}\\)\nThis is true.\nGraph of a line, origin O. Horizontal axis, coffee, kilograms, scale is 0 to 140, by 20\u2019s. Vertical axis, tea, kilograms, scale is 0 to 140, by 20\u2019s. Line starts at 0 comma 125 and passes through 30 comma 80. Points 20 comma 40 and 70 comma 100 are identified.\nImage description: <p>Graph of a line.</p>\nA point below the line:\u00a0\\((20,40)\\)\n\\(\\begin {align}12(20) + 8(40) \\leq 1,\\!000\\\\ 240 + 320 \\leq 1,\\!000\\\\ 560\\leq 1,\\!000 \\end {align}\\)\nThis is true.\nA point above the line:\u00a0\\((70,100)\\)\n\\(\\begin {align}12(70) + 8(100) \\leq 1,\\!000\\\\ 840 + 800 \\leq 1,\\!000\\\\ 1,\\!640\\leq 1,\\!000 \\end {align}\\)\nThis is false.\nThe points on the line and in the region below the line are solutions to the inequality.\u00a0Let's shade the solution region.\nIt is easy to read solutions from the graph. For example, without any computation, we can tell that \\((50,20)\\) is a solution because it falls in the shaded region. If the caf\u00e9 orders 50 kilograms of coffee and 20 kilograms of tea, the cost will be less than \\$1,000.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nImage description: <p>Graph of an inequality.</p>"
