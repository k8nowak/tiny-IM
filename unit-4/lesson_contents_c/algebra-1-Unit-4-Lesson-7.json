    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students build on their understanding of linear inequalities in two variables to find the solutions to systems of linear inequalities in two variables.\nStudents learn that two linear inequalities that represent the constraints in the same situation form a system of inequalities, and that the solutions to the system include all numbers that satisfy both constraints simultaneously. Graphically, the solution set of the system is represented by the region where the graphs of the individual inequalities overlap.\nThroughout the lesson, students endeavor to find values that satisfy multiple constraints, both in terms of a situation and in the absence of one. The process requires that students make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1) and that students reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).",

The second represents a constraint about the difference of the two numbers.)\n\"What does a solution to the system represent?\" (The solution is a pair of numbers that simultaneously meets both constraints, or makes both equations true.)\n\"How many pairs of numbers meet both constraints at the same time?\" (Only one pair.

This motivates a desire to represent both constraints on the same graph.\nAs students work, monitor for the different ways in which they try to find a pair of values that satisfy both inequalities. Some likely approaches:\nSubstituting different \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-values into the inequalities until they find a pair that makes both inequalities true.\nVisually estimating a point in the solution region of one graph that appears likely to also be in the solution region of the other graph (for example, noticing that \\((6,4)\\) is in the solution region of each inequality.\nGraphing both inequalities on the same coordinate plane (either by using technology or by copying the line in one graph onto the other graph) and finding a point in the region where they overlap.\nIdentify students who use these or other approaches, and ask them to share during class discussion.\nMaking graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",

If the quilter bought 0 yards of the light color, he could buy up to \\(\\frac{110}{13}\\), or about 8.5, yards\u00a0of the dark color fabric.

The solution to the system is often best represented by a region on a graph.\nSuppose there are two numbers, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and there are two things we know about them.\nThe value of one number is more than double the value of the other.\nThe sum of the two numbers is less than 10.\nWe can represent these constraints with a system of inequalities.\n\\(\\begin {cases} y > 2x\\\\ x+y <10 \\end {cases}\\)\nThere are many possible pairs of numbers that meet the first constraint, for example: 1 and 3, or 4 and 9.\nThe same can be said about the second constraint, for example: 1 and 3, or 2.4 and 7.5.\nThe pair \\(x=1\\) and \\(y=3\\) meets both constraints, so it is a solution to the system.\nThe pair \\(x=4\\) and \\(y=9\\) meets the first constraint but not the second (\\(9 >2(4)\\) is a true statement, but \\(4+9<10\\) is not true.)\nRemember that graphing is a great way to show all the possible solutions to an inequality, so let\u2019s graph the solution region for each inequality.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nA graph of an inequality on a coordinate plane, origin O.
