    "Lesson Narrative": "By now students recognize that solutions to linear inequalities can be found by graphing, and that this can be done by first graphing a related equation and deciding on the solution region. In this lesson, they learn to use graphing technology to find the solution set\u00a0of a linear inequality\u00a0in two variables.\nStudents then use this skill to solve problems that involve inequalities. They write linear inequalities to represent the constraints in situations and then use the representations (including the graphs of the solutions) to answer questions about the situations. As they write inequalities from descriptions, decide on the solution sets, and interpret points in a solution region, students engage in quantitative and abstract reasoning (MP2).",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this Warm-up, students use graphing technology to graph simple linear inequalities in two variables. They practice adjusting the graphing window until the solution regions become visible and give useful information. Later in the lesson, students will write inequalities that represent constraints in different situations and find the solution sets. The exercises here prepare students to do the latter, using graphing technology.",
        "Launch": "Give students access to graphing technology.\u00a0If using Desmos:\nExplain to students that typing \"\\(< =\\)\u00a0\" gives the \\(\\le\\) symbol and typing \"\\(> =\\)\" gives the \\(\\ge\\) symbol.\nRemind students that the \\(+\\) and \\(-\\) buttons can be used to zoom in and out of the graphing window, and that the wrench button in the upper-right corner can be used to set the graphing window precisely.\nIf using other graphing technology available in your classroom:\nDemonstrate how to enter the \\(\\leq\\) and \\(\\geq\\) symbols.\nRemind students how to set a useful graphing window by zooming in or out, and how to set a precise graphing window by specifying the horizontal and vertical boundaries.\n(For technology that takes equations or inequalities in slope-intercept form only.) Remind students that some inequalities might need to be rewritten such that \\(y\\) is isolated before the inequality can be entered into the graphing tool.",

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity enables students to integrate several ideas and skills from the past few lessons. Students write inequalities in two variables to represent constraints in situations, use technology to graph the solutions, interpret points in the solution regions, and use the inequalities and the graphs to answer contextual questions. In doing so, they engage in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4).\nThe questions in this activity are written in pairs. The same constraints and contexts will be used in an upcoming lesson on systems of linear inequalities in two variables.\nDecide on the structure for the activity depending on the time available and the amount of practice each student needs. Here are some possibilities:\nAssigning all three pairs of questions to all students.\nAssigning each student a pair of questions, arranging students who work on different pairs in groups of 3, and asking them to explain their solutions to one another.\nArranging students in groups of 3, assigning the same pair of questions to each group, and\u2014for each pair of questions\u2014asking one group to present the solutions to the class.",

        "Student Task Statement": "Here are three\u00a0situations. There are two questions about each situation. For each question that you work on:\na. Write an inequality to describe\u00a0the constraints. Specify what each variable represents.\nb. Use graphing technology to graph the inequality. Sketch the solution region on the coordinate plane and label the axes.\nc. Name one solution to the inequality and explain what it represents in that situation.\nd.

        "Building on Student Thinking": "One inequality in the bank account context involves only one variable. Some students might think that all inequalities they write must include two variables. Reassure them that this might not always be the case. Consider pointing to examples from earlier activities in which they wrote or graphed inequalities such as \\(y>2\\) or \\(b<10\\).",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "This activity will require a partner.\nWithout letting your partner see it, write an equation of a line so that both the \\(x\\)-intercept and the \\(y\\)-intercept are each between -3 and 3.

In other words, your line should be the boundary between solutions and non-solutions. Shade the solutions on your graph.\nTake turns stating coordinates of points. Your partner will tell you whether your guess is a solution to their inequality. After each partner has stated a point, each may guess what the other\u2019s inequality is. If neither guesses correctly, play continues. Use the other coordinate system to keep track of your guesses.",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Select one student or one group to present their solutions for each pair of questions. Focus the discussion on how students used the inequalities and graphs to help answer the question about each situation.\nStudents who worked on the same questions might end up with different graphs and answers because they wrote different inequalities (which might not correctly represent the constraints in the situation). If this happens, analyze the different inequalities and look for the potential causes for the discrepancy. One possibility is that the wrong symbols or the wrong numbers were entered into the graphing tool.\nAnother possibility might be that students made different decisions about the quantities being assigned to the vertical and horizontal axes. In that case, both versions of the graphs might be correct, but the answers to questions might be different if one of the graphs is not interpreted correctly."

    "Student Lesson Summary": "Suppose we want to find the solution to\u00a0 \\(x - y > 5\\). We can\u00a0start by graphing the related equation \\(x - y = 5\\).\nWhen identifying\u00a0the solution\u00a0region, it is important\u00a0not to\u00a0assume that the solution will be above the line because of a \u201c>\u201d symbol or below the line because of a \u201c<\u201d symbol.\nInstead, test\u00a0the points on the line and on either side of the line, and see if they are solutions.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nGraph of a line, origin O, with grid. X axis from negative 2 to 12 by 2\u2019s. Y axis from negative 6 to 8 by 2\u2019s. Line passes through approximately 1 comma negative 4, 5 comma 0, and 12 comma 7.\nImage description: <p>Graph of a line.</p>\nFor\u00a0\u00a0\\(x-y>5\\), points on the line and above the line are not solutions to the inequality because the \\((x,y)\\) pairs\u00a0make the inequality false. Points that are below the lines are solutions, so we can shade that lower\u00a0region.\nGraphing technology can help us graph the solution to an inequality in two variables.\nMany graphing tools allow us to enter inequalities such as \\(x-y >5\\) and will show the solution region, as shown here.\nSome tools, however, may require the inequalities to be in slope-intercept form or another form before displaying the solution region. Be sure to learn how to use the graphing technology available in your classroom.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nInequality graphed on a coordinate plane. X axis from 0 to 10, by 5\u2019s.

Here are some things to consider:\nThe graphing window. If the graphing window is too small, we may not be able to really see the solution region or the boundary line, as shown here.\nThe meaning of solution points in the situation.
