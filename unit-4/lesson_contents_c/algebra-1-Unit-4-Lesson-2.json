        "Activity Narrative": "This Warm-up activates what students know about the solutions to an inequality and ways to find the solutions. For the first time, students refer to the solutions as the solution set\u00a0of the inequality. Throughout their work with one-variable inequalities, students will use the terms \u201csolutions\u201d and \u201csolution set\u201d interchangeably.\nBy now, students are likely to have internalized that a solution to an equation in one variable is a value that makes the equation true. The work here makes it explicit that we can extend this understanding of \u201csolution\u201d to inequalities in one variable.\nSome students may have been taught to solve inequalities the same way we solve equations, with the added rule along the lines of \"flip the symbol when dividing or multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number.\" They may or may not have understood why the rule is the way it is. (If a student shares this method, emphasize that they will look at different strategies in the lesson and adopt whichever ways that they can explain or justify.)\nIf students approach the last question (finding a solution to \\(7(3-x)>14\\)) by performing operations directly on the inequality but neglect to reverse the inequality symbol, they would find solutions that result in false statements. Use this opportunity to point out that we may run into problems with this method. It is not essential to discuss why or to suggest better approaches at this point. There will be other opportunities in this lesson to reason about the solutions and to witness the same issue (in the second non-optional activity\u2014\u201cEquality and Inequality\u201d).",

        "Student Task Statement": "Write 3 solutions to the inequality \\(y \\leq 9.2\\). Be prepared to explain\u00a0what makes a value a solution to this inequality.\nWrite one solution to the inequality \\(7(3-x)>14\\). Be prepared to explain your reasoning.",

        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite students to share some solutions to the first inequality and explain what it means for a value to be a solution to \\(y\\le9.2\\). Be sure to mention some negative numbers that are solutions. If necessary, show the solution set on a number line. Then, focus the discussion on the second inequality.\nAsk each student to mark the one solution they have for \\(7(3-x)>14\\) on the class number line (from the Launch). (Students could draw a point or put a dot sticker, if available, on the number line.) Discuss with students:\n\"How did you know that the value you chose is a solution?\" (When substituted for \\(x\\) in the inequality, the value makes a true statement.)\n\"What do you notice about all the points that are on the line?\" (They are all to the left side of 1.)\n\"On the number line, we can see that the solutions are values that are less than 1. All these values form the solution set to the inequality. Is there a way to write the solution set concisely, without using the number line and without writing out all the numbers less than 1?\" (We can write \\(x<1\\)).\n\"Does the solution set have anything to do with the solution to the equation \\(7(3-x)=14\\)?\" (The solution to the equation \\(x=1\\).)\n\"Why does the solution set to the inequality \\(7(3-x)>14\\) involve numbers less than 1?\" (The inequality can be taken to say \"7 times \\(3-x\\) is greater than 14.\" For the inequality to be true, \\(3-x\\) must be greater than 2. For \\(3-x\\) to be greater than 2, \\(x\\) must be less than 1.)\nHighlight that we can use a number line to concisely show the solution set to an inequality, but we can also write another inequality that shows the same information."

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity encourages students to interpret an inequality, a related equation, and its solution set in terms of a situation. A context can help students intuit why the solutions to an inequality form a ray on the number line.\nStudents may recall this way of solving inequalities from middle school, but they may also solve by testing different possible values, or by reasoning about the relationship between quantities in other ways. The work here encourages students to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2), and to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1).\nMonitor for students who use these strategies to find the solutions to \\(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\\):\nTry different values of \\(n\\) until the inequality is no longer true.\nSolve the equation \\(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\\) to find the number of students at which the costs for both options would be equal. That number is 17. Then, try a higher or lower number to see which side of the equation has a smaller value.\nPlan to have students present in this order to support moving students toward more precise mathematical reasoning.",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "If students struggle to interpret the meaning of the equation \\(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\\) and of the inequality \\(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\\), ask them to think about what each side of the equal\u00a0sign or the inequality symbol represents.\nSome students may find the solutions to \\(9(n+3) < 10(n+1)\\) by manipulating the inequality to isolate \\(n\\). Depending on the operations performed, they may once again end up with an incorrect solution set if they forget to reverse the inequality symbol. (For example, in the final step of solving, they may go from \\(\\text{-}1n<\\text{-}17\\) to \\(n < 17\\).) If this happens, ask students to check some values for \\(n\\) in these inequalities.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Make sure that students understand the meaning of the inequality in context and recognize that there are various ways to find the solutions.\nInvite previously selected students to share how they found the solution set. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.\nConnect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions such as:\n\u201cHow can you see that \u201817 students\u2019 is special in each of the strategies?\u201d\n\u201cWhich strategies are more efficient at finding \u201817 students\u2019 as a special situation?\u201d\n\u201cOnce you recognize that \u201817 students\u2019 is an important switching point, how can you efficiently determine what happens on each side of 17?\u201d\nExplain that one way to think about the solutions to the inequality is by thinking about the solution to a related equation. In this context, the solution to \\(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\\) gives us the number of students at which it would cost the same to go to either orchard. This is a boundary value for \\(n\\). On one side of the boundary, the cost of Option A would be higher. On the other side, it would be lower. We can test a value that is higher and one that is lower than this boundary value to see which one makes the inequality \\(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\\) true.\nIf a student brings up \u201cflipping the symbol when multiplying or dividing by a negative number\u201d as a strategy, acknowledge the correctness of the student\u2019s statement, while emphasizing the importance of knowing why a strategy works. Emphasize that in general it is more helpful and reliable to use reasoning strategies that we understand and can explain. If we use a rule without some idea of how it came about or why it works, we might end up misapplying it (for example, flipping the inequality symbol anytime we see a negative sign, even if we\u2019re simply adding or subtracting). If we forget or misremember the rule, we would be stuck or make errors."

The context helps to reinforce why it makes sense for the solutions to an inequality to be represented by a set of points on one side of a particular value on the number line. It also reiterates the idea that solving a related equation can help us find that boundary value. In the context of part-time jobs presented here, that boundary value is a break-even point at which the two options are equal.

    "Lesson Synthesis": "To help students synthesize the work in this lesson, display the following prompt for all to see: \"How does solving the equation \\(4x-3=12(x+3)\\) help with solving the inequality \\(4x-3\\geq 12(x+3)\\)?\"\nAsk students to explain in their own words and in writing. If time permits, ask students to share their response with a partner, and then\u00a0invite a student or two to share with the class a\u00a0particularly clear explanation that their partner\u00a0has written.",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "The equation \\(\\frac12 t = 10\\) is an equation in one variable. Its solution is any value of \\(t\\) that makes the equation true. Only \\(t=20\\) meets that requirement, so 20 is the only solution.\nThe inequality \\(\\frac12t >10\\) is an inequality in one variable. Any value of \\(t\\) that makes the inequality true is a solution. For instance, 30 and 48 are both solutions because substituting these values for \\(t\\) produces true inequalities. \\(\\frac12(30) >10\\) is true, as is \\(\\frac12(48) >10\\). Because the inequality has a range of values that make it true, we sometimes refer to all the solutions as the solution set.\nOne way to find the solutions to an inequality is by reasoning. For example, to find the solution to \\(2p<8\\), we can reason that if 2 times a value is less than 8, then that value must be less than 4. So a solution to \\(2p<8\\) is any value of \\(p\\) that is less than 4.\nAnother way to find the solutions to \\(2p<8\\) is to solve the related equation \\(2p=8\\). In this case, dividing each side of the equation by 2 gives \\(p=4\\). This point, where \\(p\\) is 4, is the boundary of the solution to the inequality.\nTo find out the range of values that make the inequality true, we can try values less than and greater than 4 in our inequality and see which ones make a true statement.\nLet's try some values less than 4:\nIf \\(p=3\\), the inequality is \\(2(3) <8\\) or \\(6 < 8\\), which is true.\nIf \\(p=\\text-1\\), the inequality is \\(2(\\text-1) < 8\\) or \\(\\text-2 <8 \\), which is also true.\nLet's try values greater than 4:\nIf \\(p=5\\), the inequality is \\(2(5)<8\\) or \\(10<8\\), which is false.\nIf \\(p=12\\), the inequality is \\(2(12) <8\\) or \\(24<8\\), which is also false.\nIn general, the inequality is false when \\(p\\) is greater than or equal to 4 and true when \\(p\\) is less than 4.\nWe can represent the solution set to an inequality by writing an inequality, \\(p<4\\), or by graphing on a number line. The ray pointing to the left represents all values less than 4.\nImage description: <p>Inequality graphed on a number line. Numbers from negative 6 to 6, by 1\u2019s.
