        "Activity Narrative": "This Warm-up gives students a chance to get an idea of how to add subjective values to a modeling situation. In later activities for this lesson, students model planning a trip using different methods of transit. One consideration for the methods of transit is which method is generally preferred. Students should keep their values in the table for an activity later in the lesson.",
        "Launch": "Tell students that they are going to explore different methods of transit, such as riding the bus, renting an electric bike, or walking.\nAsk students whether they would prefer to take a bus or walk. Would a trip in which they take the bus halfway and walk the rest be as good as one in which they ride the bus 80% of the way and walk the rest?\nDisplay the table, and give students 1\u20132 minutes to notice and wonder about what they see. Then, invite students to share their observations and questions.\nTell students, \u201cJada has assigned values to her level of enjoyment with different modes of transit. Walking is set at a baseline level of 1, and the other methods are given values relative to the baseline. For example, Jada enjoys riding a bike twice as much as walking and being in a bus half as much as walking.\u201d\nEnsure that students understand that greater numbers mean that those methods are preferred over methods with lower numbers.",
        "Student Task Statement": "Complete the table with your own relative values, giving walk the same baseline value of 1.\n | Jada's enjoyment per mi | your enjoyment per mi | bus | train | bike rental | scooter rental | walk | car\n0.5 | \n1.5 | \n2 | \n0.8 | \n1 | 1\n1.3 |",

Clarify their understanding by asking questions such as:\n\u201cWhy do you think this student gave this mode of transit a value greater than 1?\u201d (They like using that mode of transit more than walking.)\n\u201cDid anyone use a value less than 1? What does that mean?\u201d (Yes. It means that they like walking more than that mode of transit.)\n\u201cCould you rank Jada\u2019s favorite methods of transit from least favorite to most?\u201d (Yes. She likes riding the bus least, then riding a scooter a little more, then walking, then taking a car, then the train, and likes riding a bike the most.)\n\u201cWhat considerations did you use to rank your enjoyment riding a bus?\u201d (On the one hand, it is better for the environment to use public transit, and it is easy to ride without having to pay attention. On the other hand, it doesn\u2019t go directly where I want, and I\u2019d prefer not to be around so many people.)"

        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students use their insights from the unit to analyze and interpret a set of mathematical models and a set of data in context. Each situation involves more than two constraints, and can therefore be represented with a system with more than two inequalities.\nInterpreting and connecting the inequalities, the graphs, and the data set (which involves decimals) prompts students to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1), and prompts them to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).",
        "Launch": "Use Three Reads to support reading comprehension and sense-making about this problem. Display only the problem stem and the diagram, without revealing the questions.\nFor the first read, read the problem aloud, and then ask, \u201cWhat is this situation about?\u201d (transport to a destination). Listen for and clarify any questions about the context.\nAfter the second read, ask students to list any quantities that can be counted or measured (different transportation methods, cost, time, emissions, enjoyment).\nAfter the third read, reveal the question and Tyler\u2019s inequalities, and ask, \u201cWhat are some ways we might get started on this?\u201d Invite students to name some possible starting points, referring to quantities from the second read (compare the values listed in the inequalities to values given in the table).\nTo help students interpret the variables in the given inequalities as representing the number of miles traveled on each mode of transit, ask them to use the table to write an expression to represent the total emissions if they went \\(t\\) miles on the train and \\(s\\) miles on a scooter. Students should see that the expression is \\(125t + 202s\\).\nAsk for an expression representing the total enjoyment score Tyler would have for the same distances on those modes of transit (\\(2.2t+1.5s\\)).\nArrange students in groups of 2. Ask them to analyze and answer the questions about one student\u2019s trip (either Tyler\u2019s or Jada\u2019s). If time permits, the groups could analyze the other trip.\nGive students a few minutes of quiet work time and time to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a whole-class discussion.",
        "Student Task Statement": "Here is some information about different types of travel in the city where Tyler and Jada live.\n | cost | minutes per mi | emissions per mi (g CO2 per mi) | Tyler's enjoyment per mi | Jada's enjoyment per mi | bus | train | bike rental | scooter rental | walk | car\n\\$2.50 | 4.6 | 660 | 1.2 | 0.5\n\\$2.50 | 3 | 125 | 2.2 | 1.5\n\\$20 | 4 | 0 | 1.3 | 2\n\\$1 to start then\\$0.80 per mi | 4 | 202 | 1.5 | 0.8\n\\$0 | 20 | 0 | 1 | 1\n\\$0.13 | 2 | 375 | 2 | 1.3\nTyler and Jada each choose their own methods of transport using two of these options.

Ask questions such as:\n\u201cHow did you know which modes of transit each person used?\u201d (By matching the coefficients in two of the inequalities to the values in the table.)\n\u201cWhy do you think Jada and Tyler both included the inequalities in which the variables are greater than zero?\u201d (The distance on each mode of transit cannot be negative. They each used two modes of transit, so the distance on each must also not be zero.)\n\u201cHow do those inequalities affect the graph of the solution region?\u201d (They limit the solution region to the first quadrant.)\n\u201cJada and Tyler each wrote five inequalities. Could all five form a single system?\u201d (Yes) What does it mean to have a system with five inequalities?\" (There are five constraints that must be met. The solutions to the system satisfy all five constraints simultaneously.)"

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity is designed to give students opportunities to use their understandings from this unit to perform mathematical modeling.\nThe travel context is familiar from the previous activity, but students are challenged to choose quantities, determine how to represent them, interpret and reason about them, and use the model they create to make choices. It also enables students to reflect on their model and revise it as needed (MP4).\nStudents are likely to want to use graphing technology because the information involves decimals and the inequalities written would be inconvenient to graph by hand. This is an opportunity for students to choose tools strategically (MP5).",

What do you want to be true about its total distance, speed, emissions, or happiness?

Encourage students to ask questions about the mathematical thinking or design approach that went into creating the display. Here are questions for discussion, if not already mentioned by students:\n\u201cWhat constraints did every group use?\u201d (All groups used that their variables must be positive.)\n\u201cHow do the graphs of the various trips compare?\u201d (They all have an overlapping region, but some use more constraints than others.)\n\u201cDid anyone have to revise or change their model in order to come up with a solution they could use?\u201d (Yes, we didn\u2019t know what number to use for emissions, so we adjusted that number until it created a region that made sense.)\n\u201cHow did you use the graph to find a plan that works for the conditions of your trip?\u201d (We looked at the overlapping shaded regions and tried to find a grid point in that region.)"
