  "Lesson Preamble": {
    "Lesson Narrative": "This lesson serves two main goals. The first is to prompt students to write and solve inequalities to answer questions about a situation. They consider not only whether the inequalities appropriately model the situations, but also whether\u00a0there are assumptions that need to be stated and whether the solution sets make sense in context. Along the way, they practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly (MP2) and engage in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4).\nThe second goal is to practice finding the solution set to an inequality by reasoning about its composition and parts. Take \\(0.5x > 10x\\) for example. For 0.5 times a\u00a0number to be greater than 10 times the same number, the number must be negative, so the solution is \\(x<0\\). Likewise, all values of \\(x\\) are solutions to\u00a0\\(x < x + 5\\) because 5 more than a number will always be greater than that number. Students practice looking for and making use of structure (MP7) as they reason about solutions this way.\nThe lesson includes an optional activity for practice solving inequalities without a context.",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this Warm-up, students practice writing\u00a0an inequality to represent a constraint, reasoning about its solutions, and interpreting the solutions. The work here engages students in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4).\nTo write an inequality, students need to attend carefully to verbal clues so they can appropriately model the situation. The word\u00a0\"budget,\"\u00a0for instance, implies\u00a0that the exact amount given or\u00a0any\u00a0amount less\u00a0than it\u00a0meets a certain constraint,\u00a0without explicitly stating this.

Why or why not?\" (Yes. He can buy any amount as long as the\u00a0cost of the food doesn't exceed \\$55.02. This means that he can buy up to 10.4 pounds.)\n\"What is the minimum amount he could buy?\" (He could buy 0 pounds of food, but it wouldn't make sense if his goal is to feed the club members.)"

        "Activity Title": "Gasoline in the Tank",
        "Activity Narrative": "This activity enables students to use inequalities to solve a problem about a situation\u00a0whose constraints might be unfamiliar and in which multiple quantities are unknown.\nTo reason about the problem, students need to interpret the descriptions carefully and consider their assumptions about the situation. To make sense of the situation, some students may define additional variables or use\u00a0diagrams, tables, or other representations. Along the way, they engage in\u00a0aspects of modeling (MP4).\nMonitor for students who use these strategies:\nStart with an empty tank and think about the hours of mowing if there are 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . gallons of gasoline in the tank. (If the tank is empty, Han could mow for 0 hours. If it has 1 gallon, he could mow for \\(\\frac{1}{0.4}\\) (or 2.5) hours. And so on, up to 5 gallons.)\nStart with a full tank and the\u00a0maximum hours of mowing and work down to an empty tank. (If the tank has 5 gallons, Han could mow \\(\\frac {5}{0.4}\\) hours. If it has 0 gallons, then Han could mow for 0 hours.)\nWrite a series of inequalities and\u00a0equations (for instance, \\(c \\leq 5\\), where \\(c\\) is the capacity of the tank in gallons, \\(c = 0.4x\\), and \\(0.4x \\leq 5\\)), and then solve \\(0.4x \\leq 5\\).\nPlan to have students present in this order to support moving students from working with individual values to solving mathematical inequalities and equations.\nMany students are likely to say that \\(x \\leq 12.5\\) represents all possible hours of mowing. Look for students who also specify that \\(x\\) must be positive or who also write \\(x\\geq 0\\)\u00a0(or \\(0\\leq x \\leq 12.5\\)) for the\u00a0solution set. Ask them to share their thinking with the class during discussion.",
        "Launch": "Select students with different strategies, such as those described in the Activity Narrative, to share later.",
        "Student Task Statement": "Han is about to mow some lawns in his neighborhood. His lawn mower has a 5-gallon fuel tank, but Han is not sure how much gasoline is in the tank.\nHe knows, however, that the lawn mower uses 0.4 gallon of gasoline per hour of mowing.\nImage description: <p>A lawnmower on a lawn.</p>\nWhat are all the possible values for \\(x\\), the number of hours Han can mow without refilling the lawn mower?\nWrite one or more inequalities to represent your response. Be prepared to explain or show your reasoning.",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "For students struggling to express the value of \\(x\\) as an inequality, suggest they first try reasoning\u00a0about the question and finding some possible hours of mowing if Han\u00a0had, say, 1 gallon or 2 gallons of gasoline.\nOne likely incorrect answer is \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 2\\), the result of multiplying gallons by 0.4 gallons per hour. If students make\u00a0this mistake, ask, \u201cAbout how long can the mower mow with one gallon of gas?\u201d Then, ask if it is reasonable that the mower mows for 2 hours with 5 gallons of gas.",

        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite previously selected students to share their responses. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.\nConnect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions such as:\n\u201cHow did the unknown amount of gasoline show up in each strategy?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are the maximum and minimum lengths of time that Han could mow? How do those numbers show up in the strategies?\u201d\nInvite students who explicitly stated that \\(x\\) must be positive to explain why they included that lower boundary in their response. Emphasize that\u00a0although it is probably\u00a0understood from the context that the amount of gasoline in the tank cannot be negative and that the lowest possible number of hours\u00a0of mowing is 0, it is not apparent from a mathematical statement like\u00a0\\(x\\leq12.5\\). Writing \\(0\\leq x \\leq 12.5\\)\u00a0(or \\(x\\geq0\\) and \\(x\\leq 12.5\\)) makes this assumption explicit and leaves less room for misinterpretation."

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity highlights some ways to decide whether the solution set to an inequality is greater than or less than a particular boundary value (identified by solving a related equation).\nStudents are presented with two approaches to\u00a0solving an inequality. Both characters (Priya and Andre) took similar steps to solve the related equation, which gave them the same\u00a0boundary value.\u00a0But they took different paths to decide the direction of the inequality symbol.\nOne solution path involves testing a value on both sides of the boundary value, and another involves analyzing the structure of the inequality. The former is more familiar given previous work. The latter is less familiar and thus encourages students\u00a0to make sense of problems\u00a0and persevere in solving them (MP1). It is also a great opportunity for students to practice looking for and making use of structure (MP7).\nExpect students to need some support in reasoning structurally, as it is something that takes time and practice to develop.",

    "Student Lesson Summary": "Writing and solving inequalities can help us make sense of the constraints in a situation and solve problems. Let's look at\u00a0an example.\nClare would like to buy a video game system that costs \\$130 and to have some extra money for games. She has saved \\$48 so far and plans on saving \\$5 of her allowance each week. How many weeks, \\(w\\), will it be until she has enough money to buy the system and have some extra money remaining? To represent the constraints, we can write \\(48 + 5w \\geq 130\\). Let\u2019s reason about the solutions:\nBecause Clare has \\$48 already and needs to have at least \\$130 to afford the game system, she needs to save at least \\$82 more.\nIf she saves \\$5 each week, it will take at least \\(\\frac{82}{5}\\) weeks to reach \\$82.\n\\(\\frac{82}{5}\\) is 16.4. Any time shorter than 16.4 weeks won't allow her\u00a0to save\u00a0enough.\nAssuming she saves \\$5 at the end of each week (instead of saving smaller amounts throughout a week),\u00a0it will be at least 17 weeks before she can afford\u00a0the game system.\nWe can also solve by writing and solving a related equation to find the boundary value for \\(w\\), and then determine whether the solutions\u00a0are less than or greater than that value.\n\\(\\begin {align} 48 + 5w &= 130\\\\ 5w & = 82\\\\ w &=\\frac{82}{5} \\\\w&=16.4 \\end{align}\\)\nSubstituting 16.4 for \\(w\\) in the original inequality gives a true statement. (When \\(w=16.4\\), we get\u00a0\\(130 \\geq 130\\).)\nSubstituting a value greater than 16.4 for \\(w\\) also gives a\u00a0true statement. (When \\(w = 17\\), we get \\(133\\geq130\\).)\nSubstituting\u00a0a value less than 16.4 for \\(w\\) gives a false statement. (When \\(w=16\\), we get \\(128\\geq130\\).)\nThe solution set is therefore \\(w \\geq 16.4\\).\nSometimes the structure of an inequality can help us see whether the solutions are less than or greater than a boundary value. For example, to find the solutions to \\(3x > 8x\\), we can solve the equation \\(3x = 8x\\), which gives us \\(x = 0\\). Then, instead of testing values on either side of 0, we could reason as follows\u00a0about the inequality:\nIf \\(x\\) is a positive value, then \\(3x\\) would be less than \\(8x\\).\nFor \\(3x\\) to be greater than \\(8x\\), \\(x\\) must include negative values.\nFor the solutions to include negative values, they\u00a0must be less than 0, so the solution set would be\u00a0\\(x < 0\\)."
