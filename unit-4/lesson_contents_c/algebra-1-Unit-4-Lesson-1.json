        "Activity Synthesis": "Draw students' attention to\u00a0the last inequality (\\(30 \\geq h\\)). Make sure students see that, even though the symbol is read \"greater than or equal to,\" it doesn't mean that we're looking for values that are greater than or equal to 30.\u00a0 The statement reads\u00a0\"30 is greater than or equal to \\(h\\),\" which means that\u00a0\\(h\\) must be less than or equal to 30.\nNext, ask students how they know whether each of those numbers (the 50, 20, and 30, or the boundary values)\u00a0is a solution to the inequality. Emphasize that we can test those boundary values the same way we test other values\u2014by checking if they make the statement true.\nDisplay these equations in one variable for all to see: \\(h = 50\\), \\(h =20\\), and \\(30 = h\\). Discuss with students how these equations are different from the inequalities in one variable (aside from the fact that the symbols are different).\u00a0Highlight the idea that there is only one value that could make each equation\u00a0true, but there is a range of values that can make each inequality true."

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity prompts students to interpret several\u00a0inequalities that represent the\u00a0constraints in a situation. To explain what the letters in the inequalities mean in the given context, students cannot simply match the numbers in the verbal descriptions and those in the inequalities. They\u00a0must attend carefully to the symbols and any\u00a0operations (MP6), and reason both quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).\nThe work here\u00a0also engages students\u00a0in an aspect of mathematical modeling (MP4). Although students do not choose the variables to represent the essential features of a situation, they think carefully about and explain how the given models\u00a0do represent the key features of the given situation.\nAs students discuss with their partners, listen for those who could interpret the inequalities clearly and accurately. Ask them to share their interpretations later.",

Listen for and clarify any questions about the context.\nAfter the second read, ask students to list any quantities that can be counted or measured (people attending, chaperones needed, ticket price, cost of meals and entertainment, profit).\nAfter the third read, reveal the question about the inequalities, and ask, \u201cWhat are some ways we might get started on this?\u201d Invite students to name some possible starting points, referring to quantities from the second read (We could look for important values in the constraints and find them in the inequalities).",
        "Student Task Statement": "Seniors in a student council of a high school are trying to come up with a budget for the\u00a0Senior Ball. Here is some information they have gathered:\nLast year, 120 people attended. It was a success and is expected to be even bigger this year. Anywhere up to 200 people might attend.\nThere needs to be at least 1 chaperone for every 20 students.\nThe ticket price can not exceed \\$20 per person.\nThe revenue from ticket sales needs to cover the cost of the meals and entertainment, and also make\u00a0a profit of at least \\$200 to be contributed to the school.\nHere are some inequalities the seniors wrote about the situation. Each letter stands for one quantity in the situation. Determine what is meant by each letter.\n\\(t \\le 20\\)\n\\(120 \\le p \\le 200\\)\n\\(pt-m \\ge 200\\)\n\\(c \\ge \\frac{p}{20}\\)",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students may relate an inequality to a written description\u00a0simply based on the letter chosen for the variable (for example,\u00a0\u201cpeople\u201d begins with \u201cp\u201d). Push these students to explain how the\u00a0inequalities express the quantities and constraints in the\u00a0written descriptions.\nFor students unfamiliar with the notation \\(120 \\le p \\le 200\\), explain that this is a way of stating \\(120 \\le p\\) and \\( p \\le 200\\).",

        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite previously identified students to share their responses. Make sure that students understand why the symbols accurately represent the constraints in the situation.\nFor the last two inequalities, make sure that students see how the operations represent\u00a0the constraints on profit and on the number of chaperones.\nIf needed, use numbers to illustrate the relationship between variables. For example, to help students\u00a0make sense of \\(c\\geq \\frac{p}{20}\\), ask: \"How many chaperones are needed if there are 120 students?\" (at least\u00a0\\(\\frac{120}{20}\\)\u00a0(or 6) chaperones, or\u00a0\\(c \\ge\\frac{120}{20}\\)) \"180 students?\" (at least \\(\\frac{180}{20}\\)\u00a0(or 9) chaperones, or\u00a0\\(c \\ge\\frac{180}{20}\\))."

In this activity, students write inequalities to represent the\u00a0constraints in a situation. Students identify key quantities and relationships, and think about\u00a0ways to represent them. In doing so, they engage in an aspect of mathematical modeling (MP4).\nAs students work, look for those who represent the same constraint using different inequalities or equations. For example, to represent the total weight that the elevator could carry, some students may write \\(w\\leq 1,\\!500\\), some\u00a0may write \\(1,\\!500 \\geq w\\), and others\u00a0may write \\(w<1,\\!500\\)\u00a0or \\(w=1,500\\).

Consider reading aloud the different inequalities that represent the same constraint. For example, if \\(w\\) represents the total weight:\n\\(w\\leq 1,\\!500\\) can be read: \"The total weight is less than or equal to 1,500 kilograms.\" or \"The total weight is at most 1,500 kilograms.\"\n\\(1,\\!500 \\geq w\\) can be read: \"Fifteen hundred kilograms is greater than or equal to the total weight.\"\n\\(w<1,\\!500\\) or\u00a0\\(w=1,500\\) can be read: \"The total weight is less than 1,500 kilograms, or it is equal to 1,500 kilograms.\"\nFor constraints that involve multiple quantities, some students may write, for instance, \\(70\\ell + 35s + 70 \\leq 1,\\!500\\), while others may write \\(70\\ell + 35s \\leq 1,\\!430\\). Ask students why these expressions are equivalent, encouraging them to use the context in their explanation.\nPoint out that although a constraint can be written in different ways, writing it using fewer terms may be more convenient and may allow us to gain certain insights about the situation."

    "Lesson Synthesis": "Solicit from students any advantages and disadvantages for representing constraints as inequalities. Some advantages students might bring up:\nCompared to written words, inequalities are a simpler and quicker way to describe what is happening in a situation.\nIt is easier to see what values a certain quantity\u00a0could or could not take when the constraint is written with symbols and numbers.\nPossible disadvantages:\nUnless we know what the variables stand for, we can't be sure about the meaning of an inequality.\nIf we don't recall what the symbols mean or how to read them, we can't access the information.\nNext, invite students to share some advice for students who might just be learning to write inequalities to represent constraints. What should they pay attention to? What are some potential sources of confusion or error they should look out for?\u00a0 Students might mention that the following are important things to attend to:\nSpecifying the meaning of each variable\nNot using the same variable to represent different quantities\nMaking sure that the correct symbols are used to represent relationships\nUsing words to read\u00a0each inequality\u00a0to make sure that it fully represents a constraint",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "We have used equations and the equal sign to represent relationships and constraints in various situations. Not all relationships and constraints involve equality, however.\nIn some situations, one quantity is, or needs to be, greater than or less than another. To describe these\u00a0situations, we can use inequalities and symbols such as \\(<, \\leq, >\\), or \\(\\geq\\).\nWhen working with inequalities, it helps to remember what the symbol means, in words. For example:\n\\(100 < a\\) means \u201c100 is less than \\(a\\).\u201d\n\\(y \\le 55\\) means \u201c\\(y\\) is less than or equal to 55,\u201d or \"\\(y\\) is not more than 55.\"\n\\(20 > 18\\) means \u201c20 is greater than 18.\u201d\n\\(t \\ge 40\\) means \u201c\\(t\\)\u00a0is greater than or equal to 40,\u201d or \"\\(t\\) is at least 40.\"\nThese inequalities are fairly straightforward. Each inequality states the relationship between two numbers (\\(20>18\\)), or it\u00a0describes the limit or boundary of a quantity in terms of a number (\\(100).\nInequalities can also express relationships or constraints that are more complex. Here are some examples:\nThe area of a rectangle, \\(A\\), with a length of 4 meters and a width of\u00a0\\(w\\) meters is no more than 100 square meters.\n\\(A \\leq 100\\)\\(4w\\leq100\\)\nTo cover all the expenses of a musical production each week, the number of weekday tickets sold, \\(d\\), and the number of weekend tickets sold, \\(s\\), must be greater than 4,000.\n\\(d + s>4,\\!000\\)\nElena would like the number of hours she works in a week, \\(h\\), to be more than 5 but no more than 20.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\\(h>5\\)\\(h \\leq 20\\)\nThe total cost, \\(T\\), of buying \\(a\\) adult shirts and \\(c\\) child\u00a0shirts must be less than 150. Adult shirts are \\$12 each, and child\u00a0shirts are \\$7 each.\n\\(T<150\\)\\(12a + 7c < 150\\)\nIn upcoming lessons, we\u2019ll use inequalities to help us solve problems."
