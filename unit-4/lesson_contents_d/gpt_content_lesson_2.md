## Activity 0: Find a Value, Any Value





----------------------------------------

### Activity 0 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned that a solution to an inequality is a value that makes the inequality true, referred to as the "solution set." They practiced identifying solutions to both simple inequalities and a more complex inequality, \\(7(3-x)>14\\), using a number line for visualization. They realized the importance of correctly handling the inequality symbol, especially when manipulating the inequality. Overall, they discovered that solutions can be represented both visually on a number line and algebraically, reinforcing their understanding of inequalities and their solution sets.

Activity 0 Title: Find a Value, Any Value

Activity 0 Timing: 5 mins

Activity 0 Narrative: This Warm-up activates what students know about the solutions to an inequality and ways to find the solutions. For the first time, students refer to the solutions as the solution set of the inequality. Throughout their work with one-variable inequalities, students will use the terms “solutions” and “solution set” interchangeably.
By now, students are likely to have internalized that a solution to an equation in one variable is a value that makes the equation true. The work here makes it explicit that we can extend this understanding of “solution” to inequalities in one variable.
Some students may have been taught to solve inequalities the same way we solve equations, with the added rule along the lines of "flip the symbol when dividing or multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number." They may or may not have understood why the rule is the way it is. (If a student shares this method, emphasize that they will look at different strategies in the lesson and adopt whichever ways that they can explain or justify.)
If students approach the last question (finding a solution to \(7(3-x)>14\)) by performing operations directly on the inequality but neglect to reverse the inequality symbol, they would find solutions that result in false statements. Use this opportunity to point out that we may run into problems with this method. It is not essential to discuss why or to suggest better approaches at this point. There will be other opportunities in this lesson to reason about the solutions and to witness the same issue (in the second non-optional activity—“Equality and Inequality”).

Activity 0 Launch: Display a number line for all to see that looks like this:
Image description: <p>Blank horizontal number line from negative 10 to 10 by 1’s.</p>
Tell students that, if needed, they can use the number line to help them in reasoning about the inequalities.

Activity 0 Task Statement: Write 3 solutions to the inequality \(y \leq 9.2\). Be prepared to explain what makes a value a solution to this inequality.
Write one solution to the inequality \(7(3-x)>14\). Be prepared to explain your reasoning.

Activity 0 Synthesis: Invite students to share some solutions to the first inequality and explain what it means for a value to be a solution to \(y\le9.2\). Be sure to mention some negative numbers that are solutions. If necessary, show the solution set on a number line. Then, focus the discussion on the second inequality.
Ask each student to mark the one solution they have for \(7(3-x)>14\) on the class number line (from the Launch). (Students could draw a point or put a dot sticker, if available, on the number line.) Discuss with students:
"How did you know that the value you chose is a solution?" (When substituted for \(x\) in the inequality, the value makes a true statement.)
"What do you notice about all the points that are on the line?" (They are all to the left side of 1.)
"On the number line, we can see that the solutions are values that are less than 1. All these values form the solution set to the inequality. Is there a way to write the solution set concisely, without using the number line and without writing out all the numbers less than 1?" (We can write \(x<1\)).
"Does the solution set have anything to do with the solution to the equation \(7(3-x)=14\)?" (The solution to the equation \(x=1\).)
"Why does the solution set to the inequality \(7(3-x)>14\) involve numbers less than 1?" (The inequality can be taken to say "7 times \(3-x\) is greater than 14." For the inequality to be true, \(3-x\) must be greater than 2. For \(3-x\) to be greater than 2, \(x\) must be less than 1.)
Highlight that we can use a number line to concisely show the solution set to an inequality, but we can also write another inequality that shows the same information.

## Activity 1: Off to an Orchard





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned how to interpret inequalities and related equations through a practical scenario comparing costs for field trips. They realized that the inequality \\(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\\) shows under what conditions one option is cheaper than the other. They explored different strategies to solve the inequality and identified the critical number, 17, where costs are equal. This understanding helps them see the importance of reasoning through problems rather than just applying rules.

Activity 1 Title: Off to an Orchard

Activity 1 Timing: 20 mins

Activity 1 Narrative: This activity encourages students to interpret an inequality, a related equation, and its solution set in terms of a situation. A context can help students intuit why the solutions to an inequality form a ray on the number line.
Students may recall this way of solving inequalities from middle school, but they may also solve by testing different possible values, or by reasoning about the relationship between quantities in other ways. The work here encourages students to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2), and to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1).
Monitor for students who use these strategies to find the solutions to \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\):
Try different values of \(n\) until the inequality is no longer true.
Solve the equation \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\) to find the number of students at which the costs for both options would be equal. That number is 17. Then, try a higher or lower number to see which side of the equation has a smaller value.
Plan to have students present in this order to support moving students toward more precise mathematical reasoning.

Activity 1 Launch: Read the first part of the task statement with the class, and make sure that students understand the given information.
Arrange students in groups of 2. For the first set of questions, ask one partner to find the cost of going to Orchard A and the other partner to find the cost of going to Orchard B, and then to compare the costs. Before students move on to the second set of questions, pause to hear which option works best for 8, 12, and 30 students.

Activity 1 Task Statement: A teacher is choosing between two options for a class field trip to an orchard.
At Orchard A, admission costs \$9 per person and 3 chaperones are required.
At Orchard B, the cost is \$10 per person, but only 1 chaperone is required.
At each orchard, the same price applies to both chaperones and students.
Image description: <p>Apple trees in an apple orchard</p>
Which orchard would be cheaper to visit if the class has:8 students?12 students?30 students?
Which orchard would be cheaper to visit if the class has:
8 students?
12 students?
30 students?
To help her compare the cost of her two options, the teacher first writes the equation \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\), and then she writes the inequality \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\).What does \(n\) represent in each statement?In this situation, what does the equation \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\) mean?What does the solution to the inequality \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\) tell us?Graph the solution to the inequality on the number line. Be prepared to show or explain your reasoning.
To help her compare the cost of her two options, the teacher first writes the equation \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\), and then she writes the inequality \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\).
What does \(n\) represent in each statement?
In this situation, what does the equation \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\) mean?
What does the solution to the inequality \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\) tell us?
Graph the solution to the inequality on the number line. Be prepared to show or explain your reasoning.
Image description: <p><strong>Blank horizontal number line with 21 evenly-spaced tick marks and no labels.</strong></p>

Activity 1 Synthesis: Make sure that students understand the meaning of the inequality in context and recognize that there are various ways to find the solutions.
Invite previously selected students to share how they found the solution set. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.
Connect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions such as:
“How can you see that ‘17 students’ is special in each of the strategies?”
“Which strategies are more efficient at finding ‘17 students’ as a special situation?”
“Once you recognize that ‘17 students’ is an important switching point, how can you efficiently determine what happens on each side of 17?”
Explain that one way to think about the solutions to the inequality is by thinking about the solution to a related equation. In this context, the solution to \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\) gives us the number of students at which it would cost the same to go to either orchard. This is a boundary value for \(n\). On one side of the boundary, the cost of Option A would be higher. On the other side, it would be lower. We can test a value that is higher and one that is lower than this boundary value to see which one makes the inequality \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\) true.
If a student brings up “flipping the symbol when multiplying or dividing by a negative number” as a strategy, acknowledge the correctness of the student’s statement, while emphasizing the importance of knowing why a strategy works. Emphasize that in general it is more helpful and reliable to use reasoning strategies that we understand and can explain. If we use a rule without some idea of how it came about or why it works, we might end up misapplying it (for example, flipping the inequality symbol anytime we see a negative sign, even if we’re simply adding or subtracting). If we forget or misremember the rule, we would be stuck or make errors.

## Activity 2: Part-Time Work





----------------------------------------

### Activity 2 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned how to compare the pay from two part-time jobs using equations and inequalities. They realized that solving the equation helps identify the break-even point where earnings from both jobs are equal. They also discovered how to represent and interpret the solutions on a number line, understanding which job pays more based on the number of hours worked. The key insight was that even though the hotel job has a transportation allowance, the restaurant job becomes more lucrative after working about 16.5 hours due to a higher pay rate.

----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to visualize and solve inequalities by graphing two expressions and comparing their values.
