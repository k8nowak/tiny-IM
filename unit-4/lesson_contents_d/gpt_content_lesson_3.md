## Activity 0: Dinner for Drama Club





----------------------------------------

### Activity 0 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to write an inequality to represent a budget constraint. They realized that the budget allows for a range of possible solutions, not just a single value. Kiran can spend up to $55.02 for food, which translates to a maximum of 10.4 pounds of prepared dishes. Students understood they could buy less than this maximum, including the possibility of buying no food at all, though that wouldn't meet the goal of feeding the drama club.

Activity 0 Title: Dinner for Drama Club

Activity 0 Timing: 5 mins

Activity 0 Narrative: In this Warm-up, students practice writing an inequality to represent a constraint, reasoning about its solutions, and interpreting the solutions. The work here engages students in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4).
To write an inequality, students need to attend carefully to verbal clues so they can appropriately model the situation. The word "budget," for instance, implies that the exact amount given or any amount less than it meets a certain constraint, without explicitly stating this. When thinking about how many pounds of food Kiran can buy, students should also recognize that the answer involves a range, rather than a single value.

Activity 0 Launch: 

Activity 0 Task Statement: Kiran is getting dinner for his drama club on the evening of their final rehearsal. The budget for dinner is \$60.
Kiran plans to buy some prepared dishes from a supermarket. The prepared dishes are sold by the pound, at \$5.29 a pound. He also plans to buy two large bottles of sparkling water at \$2.49 each.
Represent the constraints in the situation mathematically. If you use variables, specify what each one means.
How many pounds of prepared dishes can Kiran buy? Explain or show your reasoning.

Activity 0 Synthesis: Make sure students see that one or more inequalities that appropriately model the situation. Then, focus the discussion on the solution set. Discuss questions such as:
"What strategy did you use to find the number of pounds of dishes Kiran could buy?"
"Does Kiran have to buy exactly 10.4 pounds of dishes?" (No.) "Can he buy less? Why or why not?" (Yes. He can buy any amount as long as the cost of the food doesn't exceed \$55.02. This means that he can buy up to 10.4 pounds.)
"What is the minimum amount he could buy?" (He could buy 0 pounds of food, but it wouldn't make sense if his goal is to feed the club members.)

## Activity 1: Gasoline in the Tank





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to use inequalities to solve for the possible mowing hours based on an unknown amount of gasoline in a lawn mower's tank. They realized the importance of defining additional variables and clearly representing their reasoning, including establishing boundaries for the variable \\(x\\) (number of hours Han can mow). Students recognized that \\(x\\) must be positive and wrote inequalities like \\(0 \\leq x \\leq 12.5\\) to avoid misinterpretation, highlighting the need for clarity in mathematical expressions.

## Activity 2: Different Ways of Solving





----------------------------------------

### Activity 2 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned that there are different methods for solving inequalities that lead to the same solution set. They explored two strategies: testing values near a boundary (Andre's method) and analyzing the structure of the inequality (Priya's method). This highlighted the importance of understanding and reasoning through mathematical problems in various ways. Students practiced both strategies and recognized that regardless of the method, the outcome remains consistent.

Activity 2 Title: Different Ways of Solving

Activity 2 Timing: 20 mins

Activity 2 Narrative: This activity highlights some ways to decide whether the solution set to an inequality is greater than or less than a particular boundary value (identified by solving a related equation).
Students are presented with two approaches to solving an inequality. Both characters (Priya and Andre) took similar steps to solve the related equation, which gave them the same boundary value. But they took different paths to decide the direction of the inequality symbol.
One solution path involves testing a value on both sides of the boundary value, and another involves analyzing the structure of the inequality. The former is more familiar given previous work. The latter is less familiar and thus encourages students to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1). It is also a great opportunity for students to practice looking for and making use of structure (MP7).
Expect students to need some support in reasoning structurally, as it is something that takes time and practice to develop.

Activity 2 Launch: Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet time to make sense of what Andre and Priya have done, and then time to discuss their thinking with their partner. Pause for a class discussion before students move to the second set of questions and try to solve inequalities using Andre's and Priya's methods.
Select students to share their analyses of Andre's and Priya's work. Make sure students can follow Priya's reasoning and understand how Priya decided on \(x<3\) by focusing her comparison on \(4x + 3\) and \(18-x\).

Activity 2 Task Statement: Andre and Priya used different strategies to solve the following inequality but reached the same solution.
\(2(2x + 1.5) < 18 - x\)
Make sense of each strategy until you can explain what each student has done.Andre\(\displaystyle \begin {align} 2 (2x + 1.5) &=18 - x\\ 4x + 3 &= 18 - x\\ 4x -15 &=  \text-x\\ \text -15 &= \text-5x\\ 3& = x \end{align}\)Testing to see if \(x = 4\) is a solution:\(\displaystyle \begin {align} 2(2 \cdot 4 + 1.5) &< 18 - 4\\ 2(9.5) &<14\\ 19 &<14 \end{align}\)The inequality is false, so 4 is not a solution. If a number greater than 3 is not a solution, the solution must be less than 3, or \(3 > x\).Priya\(\displaystyle \begin {align}2 (2x + 1.5) &= 18 - x\\4x + 3 &= 18 - x\\ 5x + 3 &=  18\\ 5x &= 15\\ x &= 3 \end{align}\)In \(4x + 3 = 18 - x\), there is \(4x\) on the left and \(\text-x\) on the right. If \(x\) is a negative number, \(4x+3\) could be positive or negative, but \(18-x\) will always be positive.For \(4x+3<18-x\) to be true, \(x\) must include negative numbers or \(x\) must be less than 3.
Make sense of each strategy until you can explain what each student has done.
Andre
\(\displaystyle \begin {align} 2 (2x + 1.5) &=18 - x\\ 4x + 3 &= 18 - x\\ 4x -15 &=  \text-x\\ \text -15 &= \text-5x\\ 3& = x \end{align}\)
Testing to see if \(x = 4\) is a solution:
\(\displaystyle \begin {align} 2(2 \cdot 4 + 1.5) &< 18 - 4\\ 2(9.5) &<14\\ 19 &<14 \end{align}\)
The inequality is false, so 4 is not a solution. If a number greater than 3 is not a solution, the solution must be less than 3, or \(3 > x\).
Priya
\(\displaystyle \begin {align}2 (2x + 1.5) &= 18 - x\\4x + 3 &= 18 - x\\ 5x + 3 &=  18\\ 5x &= 15\\ x &= 3 \end{align}\)
In \(4x + 3 = 18 - x\), there is \(4x\) on the left and \(\text-x\) on the right.
If \(x\) is a negative number, \(4x+3\) could be positive or negative, but \(18-x\) will always be positive.
For \(4x+3<18-x\) to be true, \(x\) must include negative numbers or \(x\) must be less than 3.
Here are four inequalities. \(\frac15 p > \text-10\). \(4(x+7) \leq \text 4(2x + 8)\)\(\text-9n <36\)\(\frac {c}{3} < \text-2(c-7)\)Work with a partner to decide on at least two inequalities to solve. Solve one inequality using Andre's strategy (by testing values on either side of the given solution), while your partner uses Priya's strategy (by reasoning about the parts of the inequality). Switch strategies for the other inequality.

Activity 2 Synthesis: Students should recognize that the solution set for each inequality should be the same regardless of the reasoning method used.
Select as many students as time permits to share how they used a strategy similar to Priya's to determine the solution set of each inequality. There may be more than one way to reason structurally about a solution set. Invite students who reason in different ways to share their thinking. Record and display their thinking for all to see.

## Activity 3: Matching Inequalities and Solutions





----------------------------------------

### Activity 3 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned how to match inequalities with their corresponding solution graphs. They practiced different strategies, such as solving related equations, testing values, and analyzing the inequality structure. A key insight was recognizing that understanding the inequality's features helps determine solution ranges. Some students faced challenges in this reasoning process, which will be addressed in future discussions.

Activity 3 Title: Matching Inequalities and Solutions

Activity 3 Timing: 15 mins

Activity 3 Narrative: This optional activity gives students additional practice in reasoning about the solutions to inequalities without a context. Students can match the inequalities and solutions in a variety of ways—by testing different values, by solving a related equation and then testing values on either side of that solution, by reasoning about the parts of an inequality or its structure, or by graphing each side of an inequality as a linear function.
For all of the inequalities, after students find the boundary value by solving a related equation, the range of the solutions can be determined by analyzing the structure of the inequality. Monitor for students who do so, and ask them to share their reasoning during class discussion later.
As students work, also make note of any common challenges or errors so they can be addressed.

Activity 3 Launch: 

Activity 3 Task Statement: Match each inequality to a graph that represents its solutions. Be prepared to explain or show your reasoning.
\(6x \leq 3x\)
\(\frac14 x > \text-\frac12\)
\(5x + 4 \geq 7x\)
\(8x - 2< -4(x-1)\)
\(\dfrac{4x-1}{3} > \text-1\)
\(\frac{12}{5}-\frac {x}{5} \leq x\)

F

Activity 3 Synthesis: Select students who used different strategies—especially those who made use of the structure of the inequalities—to share their thinking. If no students found solution sets by thinking about the features of the inequalities, demonstrate the reasoning process with one or two examples. For instance:
\(6x \leq 3x\): After finding \(x = 0\) as the solution to \(6x=3x\), we can reason that for \(6x\) to be less than \(3x\), \(x\) must include negative numbers, so the solution must be \(x \leq 0\).
\(\dfrac{4x-1}{3}>\text-1\): After finding \(x = \text- \frac12\) as the solution to the related equation \(\dfrac{4x-1}{3}=\text-1\), we can reason that as \(x\) gets smaller, \(\dfrac{4x-1}{3}\) is also going to get smaller. For that expression to be greater than -1, \(x\) will have be to greater than \(\text-\frac12\).
If time permits, ask students to choose a different inequality and to try reasoning this way about its solution.
