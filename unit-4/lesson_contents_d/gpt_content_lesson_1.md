## Activity 0: What Do Those Symbols Mean?





----------------------------------------

### Activity 0 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned about inequality symbols (\\(\\lt\\), \\(\\gt\\), \\(\\leq\\), \\(\\geq\\\\)) and how they define ranges of values that can be solutions. They realized that even boundary values can be checked to see if they satisfy the inequality. Students also understood the difference between inequalities, which have multiple solutions, and equations, which have a single solution.

Activity 0 Title: What Do Those Symbols Mean?

Activity 0 Timing: 5 mins

Activity 0 Narrative: In this activity, students recall the meaning of inequality symbols (\(\lt\), \(\gt\), \(\leq\), and \(\geq\)) and the meaning of “solutions to an inequality." They are reminded that an inequality in one variable can have a range of values that make the statement true. Students also pay attention to the value that is at the boundary of an inequality and consider whether it is or isn't a solution to an inequality.

Activity 0 Launch: Give students 1–2 minutes of quiet work time. Follow with a whole-class discussion.

Activity 0 Task Statement: Match each inequality to the meaning of a symbol within it. Read the inequality from left to right.\(h>50\)\(h \leq 20\)\(30 \geq h\)less than or equal togreater thangreater than or equal to
Match each inequality to the meaning of a symbol within it. Read the inequality from left to right.
\(h>50\)
\(h \leq 20\)
\(30 \geq h\)
less than or equal to
greater than
greater than or equal to
Is 25 a solution to any of the inequalities? Which one(s)?
Is 40 a solution to any of the inequalities? Which one(s)?
Is 30 a solution to any of the inequalities? Which one(s)?

Activity 0 Synthesis: Draw students' attention to the last inequality (\(30 \geq h\)). Make sure students see that, even though the symbol is read "greater than or equal to," it doesn't mean that we're looking for values that are greater than or equal to 30.  The statement reads "30 is greater than or equal to \(h\)," which means that \(h\) must be less than or equal to 30.
Next, ask students how they know whether each of those numbers (the 50, 20, and 30, or the boundary values) is a solution to the inequality. Emphasize that we can test those boundary values the same way we test other values—by checking if they make the statement true.
Display these equations in one variable for all to see: \(h = 50\), \(h =20\), and \(30 = h\). Discuss with students how these equations are different from the inequalities in one variable (aside from the fact that the symbols are different). Highlight the idea that there is only one value that could make each equation true, but there is a range of values that can make each inequality true.

## Activity 1: Planning the Senior Ball





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to interpret inequalities that represent constraints for planning the Senior Ball. They realized that understanding the meanings of the letters in the inequalities requires careful attention to symbols and operations. Students engaged in mathematical modeling by connecting these inequalities to real-world factors, such as budget limits and attendance requirements. They identified key variables, shared their interpretations, and worked together to clarify how the inequalities reflected the event's constraints, particularly regarding ticket prices and chaperone needs.

Activity 1 Title: Planning the Senior Ball

Activity 1 Timing: 15 mins

Activity 1 Narrative: This activity prompts students to interpret several inequalities that represent the constraints in a situation. To explain what the letters in the inequalities mean in the given context, students cannot simply match the numbers in the verbal descriptions and those in the inequalities. They must attend carefully to the symbols and any operations (MP6), and reason both quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).
The work here also engages students in an aspect of mathematical modeling (MP4). Although students do not choose the variables to represent the essential features of a situation, they think carefully about and explain how the given models do represent the key features of the given situation.
As students discuss with their partners, listen for those who could interpret the inequalities clearly and accurately. Ask them to share their interpretations later.

Activity 1 Launch: Arrange students in groups of 2. Give them a few minutes of quiet think time, followed by some time to share their thinking with their partner.
Use Three Reads to support reading comprehension and sense-making about this problem. Display only the problem stem and bulleted information, without revealing the questions.
For the first read, read the problem aloud, and then ask, “What is this situation about?” (budgeting the Senior Ball). Listen for and clarify any questions about the context.
After the second read, ask students to list any quantities that can be counted or measured (people attending, chaperones needed, ticket price, cost of meals and entertainment, profit).
After the third read, reveal the question about the inequalities, and ask, “What are some ways we might get started on this?” Invite students to name some possible starting points, referring to quantities from the second read (We could look for important values in the constraints and find them in the inequalities).

Activity 1 Task Statement: Seniors in a student council of a high school are trying to come up with a budget for the Senior Ball. Here is some information they have gathered:
Last year, 120 people attended. It was a success and is expected to be even bigger this year. Anywhere up to 200 people might attend.
There needs to be at least 1 chaperone for every 20 students.
The ticket price can not exceed \$20 per person.
The revenue from ticket sales needs to cover the cost of the meals and entertainment, and also make a profit of at least \$200 to be contributed to the school.
Here are some inequalities the seniors wrote about the situation. Each letter stands for one quantity in the situation. Determine what is meant by each letter.
\(t \le 20\)
\(120 \le p \le 200\)
\(pt-m \ge 200\)
\(c \ge \frac{p}{20}\)

Activity 1 Synthesis: Invite previously identified students to share their responses. Make sure that students understand why the symbols accurately represent the constraints in the situation.
For the last two inequalities, make sure that students see how the operations represent the constraints on profit and on the number of chaperones.
If needed, use numbers to illustrate the relationship between variables. For example, to help students make sense of \(c\geq \frac{p}{20}\), ask: "How many chaperones are needed if there are 120 students?" (at least \(\frac{120}{20}\) (or 6) chaperones, or \(c \ge\frac{120}{20}\)) "180 students?" (at least \(\frac{180}{20}\) (or 9) chaperones, or \(c \ge\frac{180}{20}\)).

## Activity 2: Elevator Constraints





----------------------------------------

### Activity 2 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to write inequalities representing constraints in a real-world scenario involving an elevator. They realized that the same constraints can be expressed in different forms, such as \\(w \\leq 1,500\\) or \\(1,500 \\geq w\\). Students practiced mathematical modeling by identifying key quantities and refining their equations through peer discussion, enhancing clarity and communication. Ultimately, they discovered that simplifying expressions can highlight important insights about the situation.

Activity 2 Title: Elevator Constraints

Activity 2 Timing: 15 mins

Activity 2 Narrative: Previously, students interpreted given inequalities and made sense of them in terms of a situation. In this activity, students write inequalities to represent the constraints in a situation. Students identify key quantities and relationships, and think about ways to represent them. In doing so, they engage in an aspect of mathematical modeling (MP4).
As students work, look for those who represent the same constraint using different inequalities or equations. For example, to represent the total weight that the elevator could carry, some students may write \(w\leq 1,\!500\), some may write \(1,\!500 \geq w\), and others may write \(w<1,\!500\) or \(w=1,500\). Ask students with contrasting statements to share their responses later.

Activity 2 Launch: Keep students in groups of 2.

Activity 2 Task Statement: An elevator in a skyscraper can hold at most 15 boxes. For safety, the car can carry a maximum of only 1,500 kg. A large box weighs 70 kg and a small box weighs 35 kg. The person riding in the elevator to deliver the boxes also weighs 70 kg.
Write as many equations and inequalities as you can think of to represent the constraints in this situation. Be sure to specify the meaning of any letters that you use. (Avoid using the letters \(z\), \(m\), or \(g\).)
Trade your work with a partner and read each other's equations and inequalities.	Explain to your partner what you think their statements mean, and listen to their explanation of yours.Make adjustments to your equations and inequalities so that they are communicated more clearly.
Explain to your partner what you think their statements mean, and listen to their explanation of yours.
Make adjustments to your equations and inequalities so that they are communicated more clearly.
Rewrite your equations and inequalities so that they would work for a different building where:	an elevator car can hold at most \(z\) boxes.each car can carry a maximum of \(m\) kilograms.the person delivering the boxes weighs \(g\) kg.
an elevator car can hold at most \(z\) boxes.
each car can carry a maximum of \(m\) kilograms.
the person delivering the boxes weighs \(g\) kg.

Activity 2 Synthesis: Invite students to share their equations and inequalities, starting with those that are more concrete (from the first question) and ending with the ones that are more abstract (from the last question).
Emphasize that the same constraints may be accurately represented by statements of different forms. Consider reading aloud the different inequalities that represent the same constraint. For example, if \(w\) represents the total weight:
\(w\leq 1,\!500\) can be read: "The total weight is less than or equal to 1,500 kilograms." or "The total weight is at most 1,500 kilograms."
\(1,\!500 \geq w\) can be read: "Fifteen hundred kilograms is greater than or equal to the total weight."
\(w<1,\!500\) or \(w=1,500\) can be read: "The total weight is less than 1,500 kilograms, or it is equal to 1,500 kilograms."
For constraints that involve multiple quantities, some students may write, for instance, \(70\ell + 35s + 70 \leq 1,\!500\), while others may write \(70\ell + 35s \leq 1,\!430\). Ask students why these expressions are equivalent, encouraging them to use the context in their explanation.
Point out that although a constraint can be written in different ways, writing it using fewer terms may be more convenient and may allow us to gain certain insights about the situation.
