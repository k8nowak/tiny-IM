# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
In this lesson, students revisit the meaning of the solutions to an inequality in one variable and recall that the solution set is a range of values. They also investigate different ways to find the solution set to an inequality.
By reasoning about the quantities and relationships in context.
By guessing some values, substituting them into the inequality, and checking them to see if they make an inequality true.
By first solving a related equation in one variable.
Along the way, students reason abstractly and quantitatively (MP2).
Two optional activities are included in this lesson. The first is to give students an additional opportunity to make sense of the solutions to an inequality in terms of a situation. The second optional activity introduces them to graphing two-variable equations as a way to find solutions to one-variable inequalities.
"""
## Learning Goals
Find the solution to a one-variable inequality by reasoning and by solving a related equation and testing values greater than and less than that solution.
Understand that the solution to an inequality is a range of values that make the inequality true.
Graph the solution to an inequality as a ray on a number line, and interpret the solution in context.
## Student-Facing Goal
Let’s find and interpret solutions to inequalities in one variable.
## Student-Facing Targets
I can solve one-variable inequalities and interpret the solutions in terms of the situation.
I can graph the solution to an inequality in one variable.
I understand that the solution to an inequality is a range of values (such as $x&gt;7$) that makes the inequality true.

Find a Value, Any Value
### Activity Narrative
"""
This Warm-up activates what students know about the solutions to an inequality and ways to find the solutions. For the first time, students refer to the solutions as the solution set of the inequality. Throughout their work with one-variable inequalities, students will use the terms “solutions” and “solution set” interchangeably.
By now, students are likely to have internalized that a solution to an equation in one variable is a value that makes the equation true. The work here makes it explicit that we can extend this understanding of “solution” to inequalities in one variable.
Some students may have been taught to solve inequalities the same way we solve equations, with the added rule along the lines of "flip the symbol when dividing or multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number." They may or may not have understood why the rule is the way it is. (If a student shares this method, emphasize that they will look at different strategies in the lesson and adopt whichever ways that they can explain or justify.)
If students approach the last question (finding a solution to \(7(3-x)>14\)) by performing operations directly on the inequality but neglect to reverse the inequality symbol, they would find solutions that result in false statements. Use this opportunity to point out that we may run into problems with this method. It is not essential to discuss why or to suggest better approaches at this point. There will be other opportunities in this lesson to reason about the solutions and to witness the same issue (in the second non-optional activity—“Equality and Inequality”).

### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share some solutions to the first inequality and explain what it means for a value to be a solution to \(y\le9.2\). Be sure to mention some negative numbers that are solutions. If necessary, show the solution set on a number line. Then, focus the discussion on the second inequality.
Ask each student to mark the one solution they have for \(7(3-x)>14\) on the class number line (from the Launch). (Students could draw a point or put a dot sticker, if available, on the number line.) Discuss with students:
"How did you know that the value you chose is a solution?" (When substituted for \(x\) in the inequality, the value makes a true statement.)
"What do you notice about all the points that are on the line?" (They are all to the left side of 1.)
"On the number line, we can see that the solutions are values that are less than 1. All these values form the solution set to the inequality. Is there a way to write the solution set concisely, without using the number line and without writing out all the numbers less than 1?" (We can write \(x<1\)).
"Does the solution set have anything to do with the solution to the equation \(7(3-x)=14\)?" (The solution to the equation \(x=1\).)
"Why does the solution set to the inequality \(7(3-x)>14\) involve numbers less than 1?" (The inequality can be taken to say "7 times \(3-x\) is greater than 14." For the inequality to be true, \(3-x\) must be greater than 2. For \(3-x\) to be greater than 2, \(x\) must be less than 1.)
Highlight that we can use a number line to concisely show the solution set to an inequality, but we can also write another inequality that shows the same information.

### Activity Narrative
"""
This activity encourages students to interpret an inequality, a related equation, and its solution set in terms of a situation. A context can help students intuit why the solutions to an inequality form a ray on the number line.
Students may recall this way of solving inequalities from middle school, but they may also solve by testing different possible values, or by reasoning about the relationship between quantities in other ways. The work here encourages students to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2), and to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (MP1).
Monitor for students who use these strategies to find the solutions to \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\):
Try different values of \(n\) until the inequality is no longer true.
Solve the equation \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\) to find the number of students at which the costs for both options would be equal. That number is 17. Then, try a higher or lower number to see which side of the equation has a smaller value.
Plan to have students present in this order to support moving students toward more precise mathematical reasoning.

Read the first part of the task statement with the class, and make sure that students understand the given information.
Arrange students in groups of 2. For the first set of questions, ask one partner to find the cost of going to Orchard A and the other partner to find the cost of going to Orchard B, and then to compare the costs. Before students move on to the second set of questions, pause to hear which option works best for 8, 12, and 30 students.
"""
### Student Task Statement
"""
A teacher is choosing between two options for a class field trip to an orchard.
At Orchard A, admission costs \$9 per person and 3 chaperones are required.
At Orchard B, the cost is \$10 per person, but only 1 chaperone is required.
At each orchard, the same price applies to both chaperones and students.

### Building on Student Thinking
"""
If students struggle to interpret the meaning of the equation \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\) and of the inequality \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\), ask them to think about what each side of the equal sign or the inequality symbol represents.
Some students may find the solutions to \(9(n+3) < 10(n+1)\) by manipulating the inequality to isolate \(n\). Depending on the operations performed, they may once again end up with an incorrect solution set if they forget to reverse the inequality symbol. (For example, in the final step of solving, they may go from \(\text{-}1n<\text{-}17\) to \(n < 17\).) If this happens, ask students to check some values for \(n\) in these inequalities.
"""
### Are You Ready for More?
"""
"""
### Activity Synthesis
Make sure that students understand the meaning of the inequality in context and recognize that there are various ways to find the solutions.
Invite previously selected students to share how they found the solution set. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.
Connect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions such as:
“How can you see that ‘17 students’ is special in each of the strategies?”
“Which strategies are more efficient at finding ‘17 students’ as a special situation?”
“Once you recognize that ‘17 students’ is an important switching point, how can you efficiently determine what happens on each side of 17?”
Explain that one way to think about the solutions to the inequality is by thinking about the solution to a related equation. In this context, the solution to \(9(n + 3) = 10(n + 1)\) gives us the number of students at which it would cost the same to go to either orchard. This is a boundary value for \(n\). On one side of the boundary, the cost of Option A would be higher. On the other side, it would be lower. We can test a value that is higher and one that is lower than this boundary value to see which one makes the inequality \(9(n + 3) < 10(n + 1)\) true.
If a student brings up “flipping the symbol when multiplying or dividing by a negative number” as a strategy, acknowledge the correctness of the student’s statement, while emphasizing the importance of knowing why a strategy works. Emphasize that in general it is more helpful and reliable to use reasoning strategies that we understand and can explain. If we use a rule without some idea of how it came about or why it works, we might end up misapplying it (for example, flipping the inequality symbol anytime we see a negative sign, even if we’re simply adding or subtracting). If we forget or misremember the rule, we would be stuck or make errors.

### Activity Narrative
"""
This optional activity gives students another opportunity to make sense, in context, of inequalities and their solutions. The context helps to reinforce why it makes sense for the solutions to an inequality to be represented by a set of points on one side of a particular value on the number line. It also reiterates the idea that solving a related equation can help us find that boundary value. In the context of part-time jobs presented here, that boundary value is a break-even point at which the two options are equal. On each side of that point, one job is more lucrative than the other.
Students are given an expression that represents the monthly pay for \(h\) hours of work at each job. The expression for the pay at the restaurant is \(7.50h + \frac {50}{4}h\)\(\). Some students may notice that this expression could be rewritten as \(20h\) and use this simpler equivalent expression throughout the activity. During the class discussion, invite students who use the simpler expression to share their rationale.

"What does the equation tell us about the situation?" (the student earning the same amount from both jobs for \(h\) hours of work)
"What does the solution mean in this situation?" (the number of hours of work that would enable the student to earn the same amount from either job)

To help pay for his tuition, a college student plans to work in the evenings and on weekends. He has been offered two part-time jobs: working in the guest-services department at a hotel and waiting tables at a popular restaurant.
The job at the hotel pays \$18 an hour and offers \$33 in transportation allowance per month.
The job at the restaurant pays \$7.50 an hour plus tips. The entire wait staff typically collects about \$50 in tips each hour. Tips are divided equally among the 4 wait-staff members who share a shift.

### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share how they determined which job pays better for different hours of work. Display the number lines that show the solution set to each inequality.
If time permits, solicit some ideas from students as to why one job—the restaurant job—continues to be the more lucrative option after 16.5 hours.
One way to make sense of this is to compare the hourly rates at the two jobs.
The pay at the restaurant, \(7.5h + \frac {50}{4}h\) could be rewritten as \(20h\), which tells us the rate of change is \$20 per hour.
At the hotel, the rate is \$18 per hour. The \$33 transportation allowance makes the total pay for this job higher up to a point, but then the higher rate of the restaurant job starts to overtake this one.
If we graph the monthly pay for each job (\(y=20h\) and \(y=18h+33\)), we can see that the two graphs intersect when \(h\) is 16.5. The graph of \(y=20h\) is has a lower \(y\)-value to the left of that point but higher value to the right of it.

## Student Lesson Summary
"""
The equation \(\frac12 t = 10\) is an equation in one variable. Its solution is any value of \(t\) that makes the equation true. Only \(t=20\) meets that requirement, so 20 is the only solution.
The inequality \(\frac12t >10\) is an inequality in one variable. Any value of \(t\) that makes the inequality true is a solution. For instance, 30 and 48 are both solutions because substituting these values for \(t\) produces true inequalities. \(\frac12(30) >10\) is true, as is \(\frac12(48) >10\). Because the inequality has a range of values that make it true, we sometimes refer to all the solutions as the solution set.
One way to find the solutions to an inequality is by reasoning. For example, to find the solution to \(2p<8\), we can reason that if 2 times a value is less than 8, then that value must be less than 4. So a solution to \(2p<8\) is any value of \(p\) that is less than 4.
Another way to find the solutions to \(2p<8\) is to solve the related equation \(2p=8\). In this case, dividing each side of the equation by 2 gives \(p=4\). This point, where \(p\) is 4, is the boundary of the solution to the inequality.
To find out the range of values that make the inequality true, we can try values less than and greater than 4 in our inequality and see which ones make a true statement.
Let's try some values less than 4:
If \(p=3\), the inequality is \(2(3) <8\) or \(6 < 8\), which is true.
If \(p=\text-1\), the inequality is \(2(\text-1) < 8\) or \(\text-2 <8 \), which is also true.
Let's try values greater than 4:
If \(p=5\), the inequality is \(2(5)<8\) or \(10<8\), which is false.
If \(p=12\), the inequality is \(2(12) <8\) or \(24<8\), which is also false.
In general, the inequality is false when \(p\) is greater than or equal to 4 and true when \(p\) is less than 4.
We can represent the solution set to an inequality by writing an inequality, \(p<4\), or by graphing on a number line. The ray pointing to the left represents all values less than 4.
