Unit 5

Functions

Lesson 6

Features of Graphs





--- What Students Do ---


In pairs, students analyze and interpret the key features of various function graphs—including intercepts, maximums, and minimums—and relate these features to real-life situations.


--- What Students Learn ---


1. Identify and interpret key features of graphs, such as intercepts, maximums, and minimums.  
2. Use function notation and describe its relation to graphical features.  
3. Understand terminology related to graphs of functions, including horizontal intercept, vertical intercept, maximum, and minimum.
