Unit 5

Functions

Lesson 12

Piecewise Functions





--- What Students Do ---


In groups, students interpret and graph piecewise functions based on real-world contexts, such as bike rental pricing and postage rates, while analyzing rules and endpoint representation in both graphical and symbolic forms.


--- What Students Learn ---


1. Understand piecewise functions and their definition based on different intervals.  
2. Sketch and interpret graphs of piecewise functions from given rules.  
3. Explain piecewise function rules in the context of real-life situations.


--- Where It Fits ---


**an exploration of piecewise functions to understand how different rules apply to different intervals of the domain**
