Unit 5

Functions

Lesson 15

Inverse Functions





--- What Students Do ---


In pairs, students implement shift ciphers to encode and decode messages, compare the encoding and decoding processes to inverse functions, and explore currency exchange to reinforce their understanding of inverse functions in a contextual setting.


--- What Students Learn ---


1. Understand the concept of inverse functions and their relationship to original functions.  
2. Describe inverse functions both verbally and through equations for given linear functions.  
3. Find the inverse of a linear function by reversing the process that defines the initial function.  


--- Where It Fits ---


*an exploration of the concept of inverse functions through contextual applications and problem-solving.*
