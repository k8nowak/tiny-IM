Lesson 5

Using Function Notation to Describe Rules (Part 2)





--- What Students Do ---


In pairs, students evaluate functions using input values, solve equations in function notation, and use technology to graph and interpret linear functions based on a real-world scenario.


--- What Students Learn ---


1. Understanding linear functions and their characteristics, including constant rate of change.  
2. Using technology to graph functions and evaluate them from their graphs.  
3. Solving equations and finding function values using function notation.
