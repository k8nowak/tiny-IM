Functions

Lesson 17

Writing Inverse Functions to Solve Problems





--- What Students Do ---


In pairs, students model real-world scenarios with linear functions, find their inverses to solve related problems, and discuss the implications of their findings.


--- What Students Learn ---


(1) writing linear functions to model data  
(2) finding the inverse of a linear function  
(3) applying inverse functions to solve problems


--- Where It Fits ---


**an exploration of inverse functions through real-world applications; a foundation for problem-solving with linear relationships**
