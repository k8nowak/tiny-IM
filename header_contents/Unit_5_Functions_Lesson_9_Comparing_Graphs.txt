Unit 5

Functions

Lesson 9

Comparing Graphs





--- What Students Do ---


In groups, analyze and compare graphs of functions representing population changes and phone ownership trends, interpreting their features and relationships using function notation.


--- What Students Learn ---


1. Interpret and solve equations of the form \\(f(x) = g(x)\\) in context by identifying intersection points on graphs.  
2. Compare and explain features of different function graphs in relation to real-world situations.  
3. Understand and interpret function notation for two or more functions.


--- Where It Fits ---


**an exploration of comparative analysis of function representations; a focus on understanding intersections and their interpretations**
