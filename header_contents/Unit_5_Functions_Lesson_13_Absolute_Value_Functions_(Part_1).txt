Unit 5

Functions

Lesson 13

Absolute Value Functions (Part 1)





--- What Students Do ---


In groups, students guess the number of objects in a jar, calculate their absolute guessing errors, create and analyze a scatter plot of the data, and explore how changing the target number affects the errors and the plot.


--- What Students Learn ---


1. Understand the relationship between guesses and absolute errors.  
2. Calculate absolute errors from numerical guesses and a target number.  
3. Analyze and describe features of a scatter plot representing the absolute error data.


--- Where It Fits ---


**an exploration of distance as a function through absolute errors; a foundation for understanding absolute value functions**


--- Required Preparation ---


Required Preparation
Activity 1
Prepare a jar that contains about 30–50 small objects, or display a picture of such a jar, such as the one in the activity’s Launch.
Activity 2
Add a scale to each axis on the blank coordinate planes in the blackline master. The scales should make it possible for students to plot all the data points (the guesses and absolute guessing errors).
Each student will need the data set and at least one coordinate plane.
If using graphing or statistical technology to calculate absolute guessing errors and to create scatter plots of the data, prepare access to the technology.
Activity 3
If using graphing or statistical technology to calculate absolute guessing errors and to create scatter plots of the data, prepare access to the technology.
