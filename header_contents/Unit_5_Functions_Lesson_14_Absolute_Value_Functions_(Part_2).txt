Lesson 14

Absolute Value Functions (Part 2)





--- What Students Do ---


In pairs, students analyze absolute value functions, graph their relationships, and describe the effects of translations on the vertex position and overall shape of the graphs.


--- What Students Learn ---


(1) Analyze the impact of adding a constant term to an absolute value function.  
(2) Interpret and represent absolute value functions using tables, graphs, and words.  
(3) Understand absolute value as a measure of distance from zero.


--- Where It Fits ---


**understanding piecewise definitions and graph transformations of absolute value functions**
