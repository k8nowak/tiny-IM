Functions

Lesson 18

Using Functions to Model Battery Power





--- What Students Do ---


In groups, analyze battery power data from a cell phone to create functions that model charging and discharging patterns, make predictions, and refine models based on new information.


--- What Students Learn ---


(1) understanding how to use functions to represent real-life situations  
(2) making predictions based on function models  
(3) interpreting the results of the function in context


--- Where It Fits ---


**an application of functions to real-world battery usage for modeling and prediction**
