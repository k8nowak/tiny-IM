Lesson 7

Using Graphs to Find Average Rate of Change





--- What Students Do ---


In groups, students estimate or calculate the average rate of change of temperature using graphs and data over specified intervals, connecting their understanding of slope to nonlinear functions.


--- What Students Learn ---


(1) understanding the concept of average rate of change  
(2) estimating or calculating the average rate of change from a graph  
(3) recognizing the relationship between the slope of a line and average rate of change
