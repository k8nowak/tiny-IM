Unit 5

Functions

Lesson 1

Describing and Graphing Situations





--- What Students Do ---


In groups of 4, students analyze real-life scenarios to identify functions by contrasting relationships in tables and graphs, sketching representations, and explaining the roles of independent and dependent variables.


--- What Students Learn ---


1. Identify a function by understanding the relationship between independent and dependent variables.  
2. Interpret and describe functions using words and graphs in context.  
3. Explain the concept of a function as one output for each input.


--- Where It Fits ---
