# Using Functions to Model Battery Power
## Preparation
## Lesson Narrative
In this culminating lesson, students use functions to model a cell phone's battery power varying over time. The relationships in each activity can be appropriately modeled with linear functions, though some students may choose to use a piecewise function in the second activity.
In the first activity, students are given a table of values showing times and percentages of battery power. They study the rates of change in the table, which are fairly constant, and produce a simple model to make a prediction.
In the second activity, students analyze images showing the battery usage of a cell phone. To gather the necessary information, students need to make sense of the numerical values and the graph on each image (MP1). They also need to determine how to organize and represent the information before they can use it to create a model.
Students engage in many aspects of the modeling cycle (MP4). They identify important quantities in a situation, reason about relationships using representations that they consider useful, analyze the relationships mathematically to draw conclusions, and reflect on their results in context. Upon gaining new information, they work to improve their model.
The modeling demand can be adjusted further, for example, by asking students to collect data from their own electronic devices, or to create presentations to explain their models.
Technology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.

### Activity Narrative
The modeling activities in this lesson center on electronic devices. This Warm-up activates students’ knowledge and personal experience with such devices, preparing them for the mathematical work ahead.
Students may not have a good sense for the answer to the last question (about comparing the lengths of charging time if the device started out with different levels of power). This is fine, as students will do some modeling with specific data later in the lesson.
### Launch
Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students 1–2 minutes of quiet think time (it is not necessary that students write responses to each question). Then, ask them to share their responses with their partner. Follow with a brief whole-class discussion.
### Activity
### Student Task Statement
Think about an electronic device with a battery that you have to charge on a regular basis.
What device is it?
When you are using the device, about how long does it take the battery to go from 100% charged to the percentage it has when you plug it in again to recharge?
About how long does it take to charge to 100% starting from 0% or nearly 0%?
Suppose you plugged in your device when the battery was 50% charged.How long do you think it would take to recharge the device to 100% compared to the time it would take if the device was at 0%? Would it be exactly half the time, more than half the time, or less than half the time it would take if starting from 0%?

### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share their characterization of the time it takes to drain and charge the battery on their device. Students are likely to bring up different factors affecting how long their device would stay charged, such as how it is used and how long or how frequently it is used. They may also bring up factors that affect charging time, such as the age of the battery or the quality of the charging cable or wireless charger used.
Highlight that both the battery life of a device after each charge and the length of charging time can vary for many reasons.

### Activity Narrative
In this activity, students analyze percentages of battery power as it is being charged, generalize how the quantities are changing, and use their generalization to predict when the battery will be fully charged. The values in the table change at a roughly constant rate, so students are likely to choose a linear model, reason about the average rate of change (which they could do in different ways), and extend that rate of change to make their prediction.
Students apply their understanding of average rate of change and linear relationships to reason about the data and to make a prediction (MP4). If students choose to use graphing technology to help with their analysis, they practice choosing appropriate tools strategically (MP5).
One variation to consider as a follow-up to this activity or to the lesson is to ask students to collect their own data on charging time. This would increase the modeling demand. If students collect their own data, they may find out that batteries tend not to charge linearly all the way to 100%. (Based on the full information, students may decide to use a piecewise function as a refined model and revisit the problem.)
### Launch
### Activity
### Student Task Statement
A cell phone is plugged in to be charged. The table shows the percentage of battery power at some times after the phone was plugged in.
time | percent charged
11:00 a.m. | 6%
11:10 a.m. | 15%
11:30 a.m. | 35%
11:40 a.m. | 43%
At what time will the battery be 100% charged? Use the data to find out and explain or show your reasoning.

### Activity Synthesis
Invite students to share their predictions and explanations. Record and display for all to see the different assumptions and choices students made. If students claim that the battery was charging at 9% every 10 minutes, ask for their reasoning. If no students mentioned computing the average rate of change between 11:00 a.m. and 11:40 a.m., ask them about it.
If variations in students' assumptions and choices led to different predictions, or if students used different representations in their reasoning, ask students to compare and contrast the different solution strategies:
"How are the solution strategies alike? How are they different?"
"How were the assumptions different in these strategies?

### Activity Narrative
Previously, students analyzed a set of data on the power levels of a battery as it was being charged. They looked for a model that enabled them to predict when the battery would be 100% charged. In this activity, they engage in a similar, yet more challenging, modeling exercise to determine when a battery would be completely out of power.
Here, students are asked to define a function and then use their function to make some predictions. Then, they evaluate their predictions and adjust the function to account for new information. Data about the situation are presented in a way that may be unfamiliar, so students need to persevere in making sense of quantities and the relationships among them (MP1).
As students work, monitor for those who use different reasoning strategies and representations as they find a model that describes how the battery power is decreasing over time. Select them to share their work later.
No time estimate is specified for this activity as the length would depend on decisions about how students' models are discussed, revised, tested, and presented. If students are to collect data using their own devices, or if they are to prepare a presentation that illustrates their results and their modeling process, additional time will be needed.
Making graphing and statistical technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).
### Launch
Ask students to close their books or devices. Then, display the following graph for all to see.
Image description: <p>graph of battery usage</p>
Tell students that the image shows the battery usage for a cell phone for 9 hours after it was fully charged. Give students a moment to observe the image and to make a prediction for how much longer the battery will last.
Poll the class on their predictions, and display the predictions for all to see. Then, ask students to work on the activity.
Consider arranging students in groups of 2–4 and asking students to pause for a whole-class discussion after the first set of questions.

Here are two more images showing the battery usage at two later times, before the battery was charged again.	Two images of advanced battery usage, 29 percent and 7 percent. 29 percent shows a graph of usage from 100 percent to 0 percent. States 13 hours ago, 4 hours left. 7 percent shows a graph of usage from 100 percent to 0 percent. States 14 hours ago, 29 minutes left.How well did the function you wrote predict the battery power 4 and 5 hours after the first image was taken (that is, 13 and 14 hours after the battery was fully charged)? Explain or show your reasoning.What do you notice about the change in the prediction at \(t=13\) and at \(t=14\)?Write a new equation for a function that would better fit the data shown in the last image.

### Student Response
### Building on Student Thinking
Because the images specify duration of time relative to the moment when they were taken, using phrases such as "9 hours ago" or "8 hours left," students may think that time was measured from a different reference point for each image. They may struggle to quantify the changes in time or to organize the values into a table. Ask students to consider when or at what power level we typically begin measuring the life of a battery. Clarify that all images referenced the time when the battery was at 100%, so they could use that as a starting point for measuring time.
### Are You Ready for More?
Would a piecewise function be a better model for capturing the data shown in all three images? If so, what might the rules of that function be?
#### Student response
### Activity Synthesis
Select students or groups to share the function they defined for the first set of questions and to explain their reasoning, including the assumptions they made. After each model is shared, ask if others had written the same equation but arrived at it a different way, or had reasoned the same way and made the same assumptions but arrived at a different model.
Then, focus the discussion on how students refined their original models to account for the new information given in the second question. Showcase the variety of strategies and representations students created to make sense of the additional data or to represent their new function.
Consider using graphing technology to graph (on the same coordinate plane) the different equations students wrote and displaying the graphs for analysis and comparison.
