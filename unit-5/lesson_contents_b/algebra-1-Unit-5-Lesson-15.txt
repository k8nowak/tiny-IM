# Lesson Preamble
## Lesson Narrative
"""
This lesson introduces students to inverse functions. The idea is developed through several contextual problems that each requires reversing a process and using outputs as inputs.
In the Warm-up and the first activity, students encounter the idea of inverse functions as they use Caesar shift ciphers to encode and decode messages. In such ciphers, encoding involves shifting the position of a letter in the alphabet a certain distance and in a certain direction. Decoding then means undoing, or reversing, the action.
In the second activity, students solve problems about currency exchange. They convert an amount in one currency (dollars) to another (pesos) and work with inverse functions as they do the opposite conversion (from pesos to dollars).
Throughout the lesson, students reason repeatedly with linear functions, working forward and backward as they perform calculations with numerical values. They practice finding regularity through repeated reasoning, which they then apply to write expressions or equations to describe inverse functions (MP8). Students continue to use multiple representations of functions and to make connections between them. In doing so, they make sense of quantities and relationships in concrete and abstract terms (MP2).
"""
## Learning Goals
Recognize that if one function takes $a$ as its input and gives $b$ as its output, its inverse function takes $b$ as its input and gives $a$ as the output.
Given a linear function in context, describe (using words or equations) its inverse function.
Understand that the inverse of a linear function can be found by reversing the process that defines the initial function.
## Student-Facing Goal
Let’s define functions forward and backward.
## Student-Facing Targets
I understand the meaning of “inverse function” and how it could be found.
When given a linear function that represents a situation, I can use words and equations to describe the inverse function.

### inverse (function)
Two functions are inverses to each other if their input-output pairs are reversed.
If one function takes \(a\) as input and gives \(b\) as an output, then the other function takes \(b\) as an input and gives \(a\) as an output.
An inverse function can sometimes be found by reversing the processes that define the first function in order to define the second function.

What Does It Say?
### Activity Narrative
"""
This Warm-up challenges students to decode a short message, prompting them to think about what was done to produce the coded message so that it could be undone. The reasoning they do here paves the way for thinking about reversing the process that defines a function and about using outputs as inputs. This will get students ready to make sense of the inverse of a function.
It is not essential that students decode the message. What is important is the awareness that cracking the code involves a reversal process.
"""
### Launch
"""
Some students may be unfamiliar with the idea of ciphers or coded messages. Offer a brief introduction, if needed.
Give students a moment of quiet think time. If students struggle to get started after some time, consider giving a clue or two:
The letters A and I are the only two letters that can stand on their own (each letter can be a word).
The word “is” is the most common two-letter word in the English language.
Leave time for class discussion, even if students have not yet managed to decipher the code at that time.

### Activity Synthesis
If one or more students were able to decode the message, ask them to share their result and how they went about decoding it. Otherwise, solicit some comments on the strategies they tried and any hypotheses on how the message was encoded. (Students are likely to hypothesize that the code is related to the position number of each letter in the alphabet.)
Then, reveal the original message. Give students a brief moment to think about how it was coded. Discuss questions such as:
"Suppose you found out that each letter in the message was encoded by using the letter 3 places after the original letter. How would you decode the secret message?" (By using the letter 3 places before that coded letter.)
"The code JRRG IRRG is produced with the same method. What does it say?" (GOOD FOOD) "What about EDEB?" (BABY)
Introduce Caesar shift cipher (or shift cipher) as a way to encrypt a message by shifting its alphabet position a certain number of places. The message in the Warm-up is called "a shift of 3" because it substitutes each letter in the original message with the letter 3 places after. A table could be used as a key. It enables us to easily see the plain-text alphabet and the cipher-text alphabet. Here is an example for a shift of 3.
plain text | cipher text
A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z
D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B | C
A similar table could be used as a key for a shift of 5, 2, -3, or any other number.
Tell students that they will use the idea of writing and decoding a cypher to think about functions.

### Activity Narrative
"""
In this activity, students are introduced to inverse functions. They begin by creating their own shift cipher and using it to encode a message. After exchanging messages with a partner and decoding each other's messages, students describe the encoding and decoding process in terms of mathematical functions.
The encoding and decoding portion of the activity can be simplified by assigning a shift number to students.
The Task Statement includes a table students can use to create a key to help with encoding and decoding.
Another tool that can be used as a key for multiple shift cipher is a cipher wheel, as shown here. If desired and if time permits, consider constructing one or asking students to do so. A template and instructions are included in the blackline master.

### Launch
"""
Arrange students in groups of 2. Tell partners that they are each to use a shift cipher to write a short secret message, exchange it with their partner's, and try to decode each other's secret message.
Tell students to look at the first table and share what they notice or wonder. Ensure that students understand how they can use the numbers in the third row to do their encoding. For example, if the code is to shift backward by 1 letter, then A (corresponding to 1) gets shifted to Z (because \(1-1=0\)).

### Activity Synthesis
Focus the discussion on the mathematical representations of ciphering and deciphering a message and their connections to functions.
Select students to share the equations they wrote for the last two questions. Display them for all to see, and ask students to make some observations. Discuss with students:
"How are the two equations alike?" (Each pair of equations have the same letters and number.)
"How are they different?" (One equation seems to undo the other. In each pair of equations, a different variable is isolated.)
"Can we think of the process of encoding a message (going from \(m\) to \(c\)) as a function? Why or why not?" (Yes. For every input letter, there is only one possible output letter.) "What would be the input and output?" (In encoding a message, the plain-text letters are the inputs. The ciphered letters are the outputs.)
"Can we think of the process of decoding a secret code (going from \(c\) to \(m\)) as a function? Why or why not?" (Yes. Every coded letter used as an input has only one output.) "What would be the input and output?" (The ciphered letters are the inputs. The plain-text letters are the outputs.)
Explain to students that, if the rule for encoding is a function, then the rule for decoding is its inverse function. Two functions are inverses to each other if their input-output pairs are reversed, so if one functions takes \(a\) as its input and gives \(b\) as an output, then the other function takes \(b\) as its input and gives \(a\) as an output.

Japanese Yen and Peruvian Soles
### Activity Narrative
"""
In this activity, students continue to develop an understanding of inverse functions, using currency exchange as a context. Students convert values in one currency into another and then the other way around. They make sense of the former as a function and the latter as the inverse of the first function.
The reasoning here builds on students' prior work on solving equations for a variable. Earlier in the course, students had isolated a variable to highlight a quantity or make it easier to compute the values of the variable. What is new here is the idea of inverse function: the recognition that a variable that is an output in one function (the one that is isolated) is an input in the inverse function, and vice versa.
Some students may choose to graph the first function (\(y=39.77s\)) and use the graph to find all the unknown values in either currency. Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).

### Activity Synthesis
Discuss with students how they found the dollar value of the amounts given in pesos. Ask questions such as:
"How did you find the inverse function?" (By reversing the steps used to find the amount in soles when we know the amount in yen. By solving for \(y\).)
"In the first function, which variable is the input and which is the output?" (Amount in yen is the input, and amount in soles is the output.)
"In the inverse function, which variable is the input and which is the output?" (Amount in soles is the input, and amount in yen is the output.)
To emphasize the two quantities switching roles, display the graphs of both functions.
Give students a moment to observe the graphs, and invite them to share something they notice and something they wonder.

# Lesson Close
## Lesson Synthesis
"""
To help students synthesize the key ideas in this lesson, discuss questions such as:
"The amount of money in cents, \(c\), is a function of the amount in dollars, \(d\). What equation can we write to represent this function?" (\(c = 100d\))
"How can we find the inverse function?" (We can reverse the process and solve for \(d\). To find the amount in cents, \(c\), we multiply the dollar amount, \(d\) by 100. To find the inverse, we divide the amount in cents by 100.)
"Why might it be helpful to find the inverse function, in this case?" (If we know an amount in cents, we can find the amount in dollars. It gives us the amount in dollars as a function of the amount in cents.)
"Let's say \(d=7w\) represents a function that gives the number of days, \(d\), in \(w\) weeks. A student says that the inverse function is \(w=7d\) because now the variables are switched. Do you agree? Why or why not?" (No. To find the number of days in \(w\) weeks, we multiply \(w\) by 7. So to find the number of weeks, \(w\), in \(d\) days, we need to divide \(d\) by 7, not multiply \(d\) by 7.)
"In general, how can you check if two functions are inverses?" (We can check if the process done to get the output of the original function gets reversed in the inverse function. If \(a\) is the input in the original function and it gives \(b\) for the output, we can see if putting \(b\) in the inverse function gives \(a\) for the output.)
"""
## Student Lesson Summary
"""
Sometimes it is useful to reverse a function so that the original output is now the input.
Suppose Han lives 400 meters from school and walks to school. A linear function gives Han's distance to school, \(D\), in meters, after he has walked \(w\) meters from home, and is defined by:
\(D= 400 - w\)
With this equation, if we know how far Han has walked from home, \(w\), we can easily find his remaining distance to school, \(D\). Here, \(w\) is the input, and \(D\) is the output.
What if we know Han's remaining distance to school, \(D\), and want to know how far he has walked, \(w\)?
We can find out by solving for \(w\):
\(\begin {align} D &= 400 - w\\ D+w &= 400\\ w &=400 - D \end{align}\)
The equation \(w=400-D\) represents the inverse of the original function.
With this equation, we can easily find how far Han has walked from home if we know his remaining distance to school. Here, \(w\) and \(D\) have switched roles: \(w\) is now the output, and \(D\) is the input.
In general, if a function takes \(a\) as its input and gives \(b\) as its output, its inverse function takes \(b\) as the input and \(a\) as the output.
