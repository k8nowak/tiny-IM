    "Lesson Narrative": "Students learned in previous courses that absolute value is the distance between a number and 0 on the number line. In this lesson, students look at the function \\(f(x) = |x|\\).\nStudents see that because the graph of the absolute value function is composed of two linear pieces that form a V\u00a0shape, the same function can also be defined as a piecewise function and described with this equation:\n\\(\\displaystyle f(x)=\\begin{cases} x,& x\\geq 0 \\\\ \\text{-}x,& x < 0 \\end{cases} \\)\nStudents also look at basic translations of the absolute value function by considering functions of the forms \\(f(x) = \\lvert x + a\\rvert\\) and \\(g(x) = \\lvert x \\rvert + b\\). \u00a0They focus on the location of the vertex of the graph, which is the highest or lowest point in an area of the graph. After noticing the influence of the constants, an optional activity is available to practice translating absolute value functions.\nStudents look for and make use of structure (MP7) to relate the translation of a graph to the terms or values in the expression that defines the function. The distinctive V shape of the graph of an absolute value function is ideal for observing how adding or subtracting a constant term affects its graph.",

The graphs have the same V shape but not the same vertex. The expressions that define the functions have a constant term added to or subtracted from the input, \\(x\\), or from the absolute value of the input, \\(|x|\\). Students observe how each constant term affects the graph and consider possible explanations.\nDynamic graphing technology can be very useful for observing how the parameters of a function are related to the features of its graph and can help students generalize their observations. Consider giving students individual access to dynamic graphing technology\u00a0and then giving them time to explain the behaviors of the graphs. If students don't have individual access, projecting the applet in the digital Launch would be helpful.\nAlthough digital tools can help students notice the connection between the parameters and the graph easily, it is still important for students to understand why they behave in that way.\nMonitor for students who use these different strategies:\nFind some input-output pairs for each function and verify that the graph contains those pairs of values.\nInterpret the expressions in terms of finding an absolute error of a guess.\nUse the position of the number added or subtracted to reason about how the inputs and outputs are affected in the graph.\nPlan to have students present in this order to support moving students from plotting points to thinking of functions as an object that can be translated.\nIn the digital version of the activity, students use an applet to adjust the parameters for translating functions. The applet allows students to see how the different values affect the graph in real time. Use the digital version if available so that students can more easily see the connections between the values added to different parts of the function and the\u00a0result for the graph.",
