    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students use average rate of change to connect their understanding of slopes from linear graphs with their understanding of increasing, constant, and decreasing sections of a nonlinear graph.\nStudents learn that average rate of change can be used to measure how fast a function changes over a given interval. This can be done when we know the input-output pairs that mark the interval of interest\u00a0or by estimating them from a graph.\nAttention to units is important in computing or estimating average rates of change\u00a0because units give meaning to how much the output quantity changes relative to the input. In thinking carefully about appropriate units to use, students practice attending to precision (MP6).\nStudents also engage in aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4) when they use a data set or a graph to compute average rates of change and then use it to analyze a situation or make predictions.",

      "average rate of change": "The average rate of change of a function is a ratio that describes how fast one quantity changes with respect to another.\nThe average rate of change for function \\(f\\) between inputs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the change in the outputs divided by the change in the inputs: \\(\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\). It is the slope of the line that connects \\((a,f(a))\\) and \\((b, f(b))\\) on the graph."

        "Activity Narrative": "In this Warm-up, students compare the changes in output (temperature) over two intervals of input (time). The temperature in one interval changes by a greater amount than in the other interval, but in the latter, temperature changes more rapidly.\nThinking about what it means for temperature to drop \u201cfaster\u201d activates the idea of rates of change and prepares for the work later in the lesson.",

        "Activity Narrative": "This activity introduces students to average rate of change\u00a0by building on what students know about rate of change and slope.\nStudents see that finding the change in the output for every unit of change in the input can be a useful way to generalize what happens between two function values, regardless of the behaviors of individual data points between them. They recognize that this number tells us how\u2014on average\u2014one quantity is changing relative to the other, and that it can be useful for comparing the trends in different intervals of a function.\nIn the activity, students find average rates of change by reasoning and using their knowledge of linear relationships. Monitor for students who use\u00a0these\u00a0strategies (the examples shown are for finding the average rate of change between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.):\nFind the hourly changes in temperature, and calculate the average. The temperature fell by \\(2^\\circ \\text{F}\\) the first hour, then \\(4^\\circ \\text{F}\\), \\(0 ^\\circ \\text{F}\\), and \\(3^\\circ \\text{F}\\) in the next three hours. The average is \\(\\frac{2+4+0+3}{4} = \\frac94\\), or \\(2.25 ^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour.\nFind the overall change in temperature, and divide it by the overall change in hours. The temperature fell \\(9^\\circ F\\) in 4 hours, which means an average drop of \\(2.25^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour.\nFind the slope of the line connecting the two end points of the interval. The slope between \\((6,17)\\) and \\((10,8)\\) is \\(\\frac{8-17}{10-6}=\\frac{\\text-9}{4}=\\text-2.25\\), which means an average drop of \\(2.25^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour.\nPlan to have students present in this order to support connecting rate of change to what students already know about slope.\nIn the Activity Synthesis, students generalize their reasoning and see that finding the average rate of change is indeed equivalent to finding the slope of the line connecting the two points.",
        "Launch": "Ask students to keep their materials closed. Display a scatter plot with the two temperature data points plotted, as shown.\nTell students that it shows the temperature at 4 p.m. and the temperature at 10 p.m.\nImage description: <p>Two points. hours since noon and temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\nAsk students,\n\u201cHow did the temperature change between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.?\u201d (It fell.)\n\u201cHow much did it fall?\u201d (17 degrees Fahrenheit)\n\u201cCan we tell how fast, or at what rate, the temperature was falling? If so, how?\u201d ((It fell 17 degrees Fahrenheit in 6 hours.\u00a0If it was falling at a constant rate, it would be falling \\(\\frac{17}{6}\\), or about 2.8, degrees Fahrenheit per hour. If we connected the points with a line and found its slope, it would be about -2.8.)\n\u201cIf not, why not?\u201d (There is not enough information about what happened in between the two data points. It might not be falling at the same rate.)\nDisplay a scatter plot with the hourly data points plotted.\nGive students a moment to notice and wonder something about the data, and solicit a few responses. If no students mention the temperatures changing at different rates (a lot, a little, or not at all) each hour, ask them about it.\n\u200b\nImage description: <p>Discrete function. hours since noon and temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\nDiscuss with students: \u201cDo the hourly data between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. help us better characterize how fast the temperature was falling between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.? Could we still say that it was falling about \\(2.8^\\circ \\text{F}\\) an hour?\u201d\nStudents are likely to comment that a line connecting \\((4,25)\\) and \\((10,8)\\) approximates the distribution of points in that interval and conclude that \\(\\text-2.8^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour is a reasonable rate to use.\nExplain to students that it can be helpful to have a way to quantify how a quantity is changing over a particular interval, without having to worry about the smaller changes in between them. The rate of \\(\\text-2.8^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour serves that purpose. It is the average rate of change between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m.\nSelect students with different strategies, such as those described in the Activity Narrative, to share later.",
