    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students focus their attention on possible input and output values. They define the list of possible inputs as the domain of the function and the possible outputs as the range of the function. They identify the domain and range of functions from graphs and descriptions of situations, then describe them using words, lists of numbers, or inequalities (if appropriate).\nStudents' analyses of inputs and outputs continue to be grounded in context, allowing many chances to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2). In an optional activity, there is an opportunity to study the domain of a function without a context.",

Acknowledge that this is a valid point, and that it highlights the need for a function to be more specifically defined in terms of when it \"begins\" and \"ends.\" If time permits, solicit some ideas on how this could be done.\nTell students that\u00a0in this lesson, they will think more about values that make sense as inputs and outputs of functions."

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students may mistakenly associate the possible inputs and outputs of a function with the horizontal and vertical values that are visible in a graphing window or with the upper and lower limits of the scale of each axis on a coordinate plane. While that is good practice in situations in which it is difficult to determine what would happen outside of what is graphed, if we understand the situation more clearly, we can sometimes say more about what is possible. For example, students may think that the set of possible outputs of the area function, \\(A\\), includes values only from 0 to 50 because the scale on the vertical axis goes from 0 to 50. Ask these students if it is possible to use a different scale on each axis or, if the function is graphed using technology, to adjust the graphing window.

Clarify that although the graph showing only points more accurately reflects the domain and range of the function, plotting those points could be pretty tedious. We could use a line graph to represent the function, as long as we specify or are clear that only whole numbers are in the domain and only multiples of 20 are in the range.\nIf time permits, draw students' attention to the temperature function they saw in an earlier activity, defined by \\(k(c) = c + 273.15\\).
