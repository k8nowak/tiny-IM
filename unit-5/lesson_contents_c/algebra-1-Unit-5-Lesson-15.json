    "Lesson Narrative": "This lesson introduces students to inverse functions. The idea is developed through several contextual problems that each requires reversing a process and using outputs as inputs.\nIn the Warm-up and the first activity, students encounter the idea of inverse functions as they use Caesar shift ciphers to encode and decode messages. In such ciphers, encoding involves shifting the position of a letter in the alphabet a certain distance and in a certain direction. Decoding then means undoing, or reversing, the action.\nIn the second activity, students solve problems about currency exchange. They convert an amount in one currency (dollars) to another (pesos)\u00a0and work with inverse functions as they do the opposite conversion (from pesos to dollars).\nThroughout the lesson, students reason repeatedly with linear functions, working forward and backward as they perform calculations with numerical values. They practice finding regularity through repeated reasoning, which they then apply to write expressions or equations to describe inverse functions (MP8). Students continue to use multiple representations of functions and to make connections between them. In doing so, they make sense of quantities and relationships in concrete and abstract terms (MP2).",

        "Activity Narrative": "This Warm-up challenges students to decode a short message, prompting them to think about what was done to produce the coded message so that it could be undone. The reasoning they do here paves the way for thinking about reversing the process that defines a function and about using outputs as inputs. This will get students ready to make sense of the inverse of a function.\nIt is not essential that students decode the message. What is important is the awareness that cracking the code involves a reversal process.",
        "Launch": "Some students may be unfamiliar with the idea of ciphers or coded messages. Offer a brief introduction, if needed.\nGive students a moment of quiet think time. If students struggle to get started after some time, consider giving a clue or two:\nThe letters A and I are the only two letters that can stand on their own (each letter can be a word).\nThe word \u201cis\u201d is the most common two-letter word in the English language.\nLeave time for class discussion, even if students have not yet managed to decipher the code at that time.",

        "Activity Synthesis": "If one or more students were able to decode the message, ask them to share their result and how they went about decoding it. Otherwise, solicit some comments on the strategies they tried and any hypotheses on how the message was encoded. (Students are likely to hypothesize that the code is related to the position number of each letter in the alphabet.)\nThen, reveal the original message. Give students a brief moment to think about how it was coded. Discuss questions such as:\n\"Suppose you found out that each letter in the message was encoded by using the letter 3 places after the original letter. How would you decode the secret message?\" (By using the letter 3 places before that coded letter.)\n\"The code JRRG IRRG is produced with the same method. What does it say?\" (GOOD FOOD) \"What about EDEB?\" (BABY)\nIntroduce Caesar shift cipher (or shift cipher) as a way to encrypt a message by shifting its alphabet position a certain number of places. The message in the Warm-up is called \"a shift of 3\" because it substitutes each letter in the original message with the letter 3 places after. A table could be used as a key.\u00a0It enables us to easily see the plain-text alphabet and the cipher-text alphabet. Here is an example for a shift of 3.\nplain text | cipher text\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z\nD | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B | C\nA similar table could be used as a key for a shift of 5, 2, -3, or any other number.\nTell students that they will use the idea of writing and decoding a cypher to think about functions."

After exchanging messages with a partner and decoding each other's messages, students describe the encoding and decoding process in terms of mathematical functions.\nThe encoding and decoding portion of the activity can be simplified by assigning a shift number to students.\nThe Task Statement includes a table students can use to create a key to help with encoding and decoding.\nAnother tool that can be used as a key for multiple shift cipher is a cipher wheel, as shown here. If desired and if time permits, consider constructing one or asking students to do so.

In each pair of equations, a different variable is isolated.)\n\"Can we think of the process of encoding a message (going from \\(m\\) to \\(c\\)) as a function? Why or why not?\" (Yes. For every input letter, there is only one possible output letter.) \"What would be the input and output?\" (In encoding a message, the plain-text letters are the inputs. The ciphered letters are the outputs.)\n\"Can we think of the process of decoding a secret code (going from \\(c\\) to \\(m\\)) as a function? Why or why not?\" (Yes. Every coded letter used as an input has only one output.) \"What would be the input and output?\" (The ciphered letters are the inputs. The plain-text letters are the outputs.)\nExplain to students that, if the rule for encoding is a function, then the rule for decoding is its inverse function. Two functions are inverses to each other if their input-output pairs are reversed, so if one functions takes \\(a\\) as its input and gives \\(b\\) as an output, then the other function takes \\(b\\) as its input and gives \\(a\\) as an output."

Students convert values in one currency into another and then the other way around.

Earlier in the course, students had isolated a variable to highlight a quantity or make it easier to compute the values of the variable. What is new here is the idea of inverse function: the recognition that a variable that is an output in one function (the one that is isolated) is an input in the inverse function, and vice versa.\nSome students may choose to graph the first function (\\(y=39.77s\\)) and use the graph to find all the unknown values in either currency.

What equation can we write to represent this function?\" (\\(c = 100d\\))\n\"How can we find the inverse function?\" (We can reverse the process and solve for \\(d\\). To find the amount in cents, \\(c\\), we multiply the dollar amount, \\(d\\) by 100. To find the inverse, we divide the amount in cents by 100.)\n\"Why might it be helpful to find the inverse function, in this case?\" (If we know an amount in cents, we can find the amount in dollars. It gives us the amount in dollars as a function of the amount in cents.)\n\"Let's say\u00a0\\(d=7w\\) represents a function that gives\u00a0the number of days, \\(d\\), in \\(w\\) weeks. A student says that the inverse function is \\(w=7d\\) because now the variables are switched. Do you agree? Why or why not?\" (No. To find the number of days in \\(w\\) weeks, we multiply \\(w\\) by 7. So to find the number of weeks, \\(w\\), in \\(d\\) days, we need to divide \\(d\\) by 7, not multiply \\(d\\) by 7.)\n\"In general, how can you check if two functions are inverses?\" (We can check if the process\u00a0done to get the output of the original function gets reversed in the inverse function. If \\(a\\) is the input in the original function and it gives \\(b\\) for the output, we can see if putting \\(b\\) in the inverse function gives \\(a\\) for the output.)",
