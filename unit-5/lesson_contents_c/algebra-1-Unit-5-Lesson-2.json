    "Lesson Narrative": "This lesson introduces students to function notation. Students encounter situations in which referring to certain functions and their input-output pairs gets complicated, wordy, or unclear. This motivates a way to talk about functions that is more concise and precise.\nStudents learn that function notation is a succinct way to name a function and to specify its input and output. They interpret function notation in terms of the quantities in a situation and use function notation to represent simple statements about a function. The work in this lesson prompts students to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2) and communicate precisely (MP6).",

        "Activity Narrative": "The goal of this Warm-up is to motivate the need for a notation that can be used to communicate about functions.\nStudents analyze three graphs from an earlier lesson, interpret various points on the graphs, and use their analyses to answer questions about the situations. This work requires students to make careful connections between points on the graphs, pairs of input and output values, and verbal descriptions of the functions. Students find that\u00a0unless each feature and the function being referred to is clearly articulated, which could be tedious to do, what they wish to communicate about the function\u00a0may be ambiguous or unclear.\nWhen answering the last two questions, students are likely to find the prompts lacking in specificity and to probe: \u201cfor which day?\u201d Suggest that they answer based on their interpretation of the questions.\nThen, look for students who assume that the questions refer to one particular function and those who assume they refer to all three functions (and consequently answer them for each function). Ask them to share their interpretations during the whole-class discussion.",

        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite students to share their response to the first set of questions.\nTo help illustrate that it could be tedious to refer to a specific part of a function fully and precisely, ask each question completely for each of the three days. (For instance, \u201cHow far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left on Day 1? How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left on Day 2?\u201d) If students offer a numerical value (for instance, \u201c1.5 feet\u201d) without stating what question it answers or to what quantity it corresponds to, ask them to clarify.\nNext, select previously identified students to share their responses to the last two questions. Regardless of whether students chose to answer them for a particular day or for all three days, point out that the answers depend on the day. When the day (or the function) is not specified, it is unclear what information is sought.\nExplain that sometimes we need to be pretty specific when talking about functions. But being specific could require many\u00a0words and become burdensome. Tell students that they will learn about a way to describe functions clearly and succinctly."
