    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students continue to expand their capacity to work with and interpret inverses of linear functions in various situations.\u00a0The situations provided in this lesson require aspects of modeling (MP4) to write functions and find their inverses.\nNote that notation\u00a0\\(f^{\\text-1}\\) is intentionally not used to denote the\u00a0inverse function at this point. This is so that students can focus their attention on the meaning of an inverse function rather than on learning a new notation. It is also to discourage students from thinking of finding an inverse function as a procedure.\nTechnology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. Consider making technology available.",

        "Launch": "Point out to students that the equations we have seen in the past few lessons use variables for the input and output. Sometimes, however, an equation that defines a function is written using function notation, so the output has the form \\(w(t)\\), or \\(\\text {function name (input variable)}\\).\nTell students that they will now think about how to represent the inverse of a function defined using function notation.",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students revisit another familiar situation: the percentage of homes that used only cell phones (instead of landline phones) as a function of time since 2004. Here, the focus is on finding a linear function that models the given data and using the model to answer questions about the situation.\nPreviously, students saw questions about percentages, such as: \u201cWhat percentage of homes had only cell phones in 2010?\u201d Here, they see questions such as\u00a0\u201cIn what year did 50% of all homes use only cell phones?\u201d or \"Solve \\(P(t)=30\\) for \\(t\\).\" Students are not explicitly asked to find the inverse of the\u00a0function, but the questions about time can be more efficiently answered by first finding the inverse of the function, motivating students to do so.\nTo write an equation for a possible linear model, students may find a line of best fit (and then determine its slope and vertical intercept, by hand or using technology), or they may find an average rate of change between two meaningful points on the data. Students engage in aspects of modeling (MP4) as they make such decisions.\nMaking graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",

        "Student Task Statement": "In 2004, less than 5% of the homes in the United States relied on a cell phone instead of a landline phone.

What equation could be written to help us find the years that correspond to those percentages? Show your reasoning.",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Students may not recall how to write an equation to model a set of data, even if they see that the points on the scatter plot appear to be linear. Ask students how they might find the rate of change in the situation or the slope of a line that could represent the trend in the data. Prompt them with questions, such as \"How quickly does the percentage of homes with only cell phones grow?\" or \"By how many percent, roughly, does it grow each year? How can we find out?\" Once they see how to estimate a rate of change or to calculate the slope of a line that fits the data, ask what other information they might need to write a linear equation.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "How well do you think your model will work to predict the percentage of homes with only a cell phone in future years, for example, a decade or two decades from now? Explain your reasoning.",
        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite students to share how they wrote an equation to model the relationship in the data. Then, focus the discussion on how they answered questions about time, such as how they solved \\(P(t)=30\\) for \\(t\\), or found the years in which the percentages of cell-phone-only homes reached 50%, 75%, and so on.\nWhen writing an equation for the last question, students may have solved for \\(t\\) without realizing that they have written an inverse of the original function. If so, highlight this connection and discuss how the inverse function could help answer the questions about time."

    "Lesson Synthesis": "Discuss with students:\n\"In this lesson, we saw some real-world situations where it was useful to find the inverse of a function. What kinds of problems does the inverse of a function allow us to solve? How do they help us understand a situation?\"",
    "Student Lesson Summary": "The water in a rain barrel is being drained and used to water a garden. Function \\(v\\) gives the volume of water remaining in the barrel, in gallons, \\(t\\) minutes after it started being drained. This equation represents the function:\n\\(v(t) = 60 - 2.25t\\)\nFrom the equation and description, we can reason that there were 60 gallons of water in the rain barrel, and that it was being drained at a constant rate of 2.25 gallons per minute.\nThis equation is handy for finding out the amount of water left in the barrel after some number of minutes. In other words, it helps us find the output, \\(v(t)\\), when we know the input, \\(t\\).\nSuppose we want to know how long it would take before the barrel has 20 gallons of water remaining\u00a0or how long it would take to empty the barrel. Let's find the inverse of function \\(v\\) so that the volume of water is the input and time is the output.\nEven though the equation is in function notation, we can still solve for \\(t\\) as we had done before:\n\\(\\begin {align} v(t) &= 60-2.25t\\\\v(t) + 2.25t &= 60\\\\ 2.25t &= 60-v(t)\\\\ t &=\\dfrac{60-v(t)}{2.25} \\end{align}\\)\nThis equation now shows \\(t\\) as the output and \\(v(t)\\) as the input. We can easily find or estimate the time when the barrel will have 20 gallons remaining by substituting 20 for \\(v(t)\\)\u00a0and then evaluating \\(\\frac{60-20}{2.25}\\).\u00a0Or we can find the time when the barrel will have 0 gallons remaining by substituting 0 for \\(v(t)\\) and evaluating \\(\\frac{60\u22120}{2.25}\\)."
