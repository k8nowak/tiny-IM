    "Lesson Narrative": "In this culminating lesson, students use functions to model\u00a0a cell phone's battery power\u00a0varying over time. The relationships in each activity can be appropriately modeled with linear functions, though some students may choose to use a piecewise function in the second activity.\nIn the first activity, students are given a table of values showing times and percentages of battery power. They study the rates of change in the table, which are fairly constant, and produce a simple model to make a prediction.\nIn the second activity, students analyze images showing the battery usage of a cell phone. To gather the necessary information, students need to make sense of the numerical values and the graph on each image (MP1). They also need to determine how to organize and represent the information before they can use it to create a model.\nStudents engage in many aspects of the modeling cycle (MP4). They identify important quantities in a situation, reason about relationships using representations that they consider useful, analyze the relationships mathematically to draw conclusions, and reflect on their results in context. Upon gaining new information, they work to improve their model.\nThe modeling demand can be adjusted further, for example, by asking students to collect data from their own electronic devices, or to create presentations to explain their models.\nTechnology isn't required for this lesson, but there are opportunities for students to choose to use appropriate technology to solve problems. We recommend making technology available.",

        "Activity Narrative": "The modeling activities in this lesson center on electronic devices. This Warm-up activates students\u2019 knowledge and personal experience with such devices, preparing them for the mathematical work ahead.\nStudents may not have a good sense for the answer to the last question (about comparing the lengths of charging time if the device started out with different levels of power). This is fine, as students will do some modeling with specific data later in the lesson.",
        "Launch": "Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students 1\u20132\u00a0minutes of quiet think time (it is not necessary that students write responses to each question).\u00a0Then, ask them to share their responses with their\u00a0partner. Follow with a brief whole-class discussion.",
        "Student Task Statement": "Think about an electronic device with a battery that you have to charge on a regular basis.\nWhat device is it?\nWhen you are using the device, about how long does it take the battery to go from 100% charged to the percentage it has when you plug it in again to recharge?\nAbout how long does it take to charge to 100% starting from 0% or nearly 0%?\nSuppose you plugged in your device when the battery was 50% charged.How long do you think it would take to recharge the device to 100% compared to the time it would take if the device was at 0%? Would it be exactly half the time, more than half the time, or less than half the time it would take if starting from 0%?\nSuppose you plugged in your device when the battery was 50% charged.\nHow long do you think it would take to recharge the device to 100% compared to the time it would take if the device was at 0%?

        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite students to share their characterization of the time it takes to drain and charge the battery on their device. Students are likely to bring up different factors affecting how long their device would stay charged, such as how it is used and how long or how frequently it is used. They may also bring up factors that affect charging time, such as the age of the battery or the quality of the charging cable or wireless charger used.\nHighlight that both the battery life of a device after each charge and the length of charging time can vary for many reasons."

        "Activity Title": "Charging a Phone",
        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students analyze percentages of battery power as it is being charged, generalize how the quantities are changing, and use their generalization to predict when the battery will be fully charged. The values in the table change at a roughly constant rate, so students are likely to choose a linear model, reason about the average rate of change (which they could do in different ways), and extend that rate of change to make their prediction.\nStudents apply their understanding of average rate of change and linear relationships to reason about the data and to make a prediction (MP4). If students choose to use graphing technology to help with their analysis, they practice choosing appropriate tools strategically (MP5).\nOne variation to consider as a follow-up to this activity or to the lesson is to ask students to collect their own data on charging time. This would increase the modeling demand. If students collect their own data, they may find out that batteries tend not to charge linearly all the way to 100%. (Based on the full information, students may decide to use a piecewise function as a refined model and revisit the problem.)",

If students claim that the battery was charging at 9% every 10 minutes, ask for their reasoning. If no students mentioned computing the average rate of change between 11:00 a.m. and 11:40 a.m., ask them about it.\nIf variations in students' assumptions and choices led to different predictions, or if students used different representations in their reasoning, ask students to compare and contrast the different solution strategies:\n\"How are the solution strategies alike? How are they different?\"\n\"How were the assumptions different in these strategies?"

        "Activity Narrative": "Previously, students analyzed a set of data on the power levels of a battery as it was being charged. They looked for a model that enabled them to predict when the battery would be 100% charged. In this activity, they engage in a similar, yet more challenging, modeling exercise to determine when a battery would be completely out of power.\nHere, students are asked to define a function and then use their function to make some predictions. Then, they evaluate their predictions and adjust the function to account for new information. Data about the situation are presented in a way that may be unfamiliar, so students need to persevere in making sense of quantities and the relationships among them (MP1).\nAs students work, monitor for those who use different reasoning strategies and representations as they find a model that describes how the battery power is decreasing over time. Select them to share their work later.\nNo time estimate is specified for this activity as the length would depend on decisions about how students' models are discussed, revised, tested, and presented. If students are to collect data using their own devices, or if they are to prepare a presentation that illustrates their results and their modeling process, additional time will be needed.\nMaking graphing and statistical technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Because the images specify duration of time relative to the moment when they were taken, using phrases such as \"9 hours ago\" or \"8 hours left,\" students may think that time was measured from a different reference point for each image. They may struggle to quantify the changes in time or to organize the values into a table. Ask students to consider when\u00a0or at what power level\u00a0we typically begin measuring the life of a battery. Clarify that all images referenced the time when the battery was at 100%, so they could use that as a starting point for measuring time.",
