## Activity 0: Make It True





----------------------------------------

### Activity 0 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

Students learned that solving equations means finding values for variables that make the equations true. They practiced this with the equation \\(q = 4 + 0.8p\\) by substituting values for \\(p\\) and finding corresponding \\(q\\) values. They also explored how to find \\(p\\) by solving the equations when given \\(q\\) values. The key insight was realizing that equations can be solved directly rather than just guessing values.

Activity 0 Title: Make It True

Activity 0 Timing: 5 mins

Activity 0 Narrative: This Warm-up refreshes the idea of evaluating and solving equations, preparing students for the main work of the lesson. It reminds students that to solve a variable equation is to find one or more values for the variable that would make the equation true. In subsequent activities, students will work with equations in function notation to find unknown input or output values.

Activity 0 Launch: 

Activity 0 Task Statement: Consider the equation \(q = 4 + 0.8p\).
What value of \(q\) would make the equation true when:\(p\) is 7?\(p\) is 100?
What value of \(q\) would make the equation true when:
\(p\) is 7?
\(p\) is 100?
What value of \(p\) would make the equation true when:\(q\) is 12?\(q\) is 60?
What value of \(p\) would make the equation true when:
\(q\) is 12?
\(q\) is 60?
Be prepared to explain or show your reasoning.

Activity 0 Synthesis: Invite students to share their response and strategy for answering the questions.
To find the values of \(p\) in the second set of questions, some students may have guessed and checked, but many students should have recognized that they could solve the equations for \(p\) (either before or after substituting the value of \(q\)). If no students mentioned solving the equations, bring it to their attention.
Remind students that to solve \(12=4+0.8p\) is to find the value of \(p\) that makes the equation true.

## Activity 1: Gaming Options





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned to evaluate functions representing costs over time after a trial period. They understood how to interpret input and output values, analyze linear functions, and solve for unknowns. A key insight was recognizing that Option A has a constant cost of $600, while Option B increases by $10 for each additional month after the trial. This comparison helped them grasp the concept of budget constraints in real-life scenarios.

Activity 1 Title: Gaming Options

Activity 1 Timing: 25 mins

Activity 1 Narrative: In this activity, students work with rules of functions that arise from situations and continue to make connections between different representations of functions. They use rules to evaluate functions and interpret the input and output values in context. For instance, students see that \(B(1)\) represents the cost of using the service 1 month beyond the trial period, and find its value by computing \(10(1)+250\).
Students also use rules of functions to solve for an unknown input value. For example, given the rule \(B(x) = 10x + 250\) and the statement \(B(x)=280\), they work to find a value of \(x\) that makes \(B(x) = 280\) true. Monitor for students who use these strategies:
Guessing and checking
Analyzing the graph of \(y=10x+250\) and identifying the \(x\)-value when \(y\) is 280
Reasoning that a budget of \$280 means that only \$30 is available for additional months, and at \$10 per month, it means 3 additional months of service.
Solving \(10x+250=280\) algebraically
Plan to have students present in this order to support moving students toward more precise algebraic thinking.

Activity 1 Launch: Arrange students in groups of 2.
As a class, read the opening paragraphs and the first question in the activity statement. Ask students, “What do \(A(1)\) and \(B(1)\) represent in this situation? What does the 1 in each expression mean?” Give students a minute of quiet think time and then time to discuss their thinking with their partner.
Invite students to share their interpretations, in particular the meaning of “trial period.” Many subscription services provide a trial period in which the service is free before users are charged for their time afterward. Before students begin the activity, make sure they see that an input value of 1 represents 1 month of the service after the trial period.
Also tell students that the providers will charge a “prorated” amount for canceling in the middle of the month. For example, if the service is canceled on the 15th of the month, the user will be charged for half of the usual month’s fees.
Select groups with different strategies, such as those described in the Activity Narrative, to share later.

Activity 1 Task Statement: Elena is looking at options for video game consoles. Each option begins with a purchase of the console and a 1 month free trial period of the online gaming service. The monthly cost of each option can be seen as a function and represented with an equation:
Option A: \(A(x) = 600\)
Option B: \(B(x) = 10x + 250\)
In each function, the input, \(x\), represents the number of months Elena uses the online gaming service after the free trial period.
Elena decides to find the values of \(A(1)\) and \(B(1)\) and compare them. What are those values?
When planning her budget, she compares \(A(7.5)\) and \(B(7.5)\). What are those values?
Describe each option in words.
Graph each function on the same coordinate plane. Then, explain which option you think she should choose.	​​​​​​​​​​​
​​​​​
Image description: <p>Blank grid. Horizontal axis, 0 to 90, months after trial. Vertical axis, 0 to 900 by 100’s, cost, dollars.</p>
​​​​​​
Elena budgeted only \$280 for the console and online service. She thought, “I wonder how many months I could have for \$280 if I go with Option B” and wrote \(B(x) = 280\). What is the answer to her question? Explain or show how you know.

Activity 1 Synthesis: The purpose of this discussion is to explore linear functions that represent situations and examine how to solve functions when the input or output value is known.
Select students to share their interpretations of the two options. Make sure students see that:
The equation \(A(x)=600\) tells us that, regardless of the number of months the service is used, \(x\), the cost, \(A(x)\) is always 600.
The \(10x\) in the rule of \(B(x)\) tells us that each extra month of service after the trial period costs \$10, and that there is a \$250 price for the console.
Explain to students that the two functions here are linear functions because the output of each function changes at a constant rate relative to the input. Option B involves a rate of change of \$10 per additional month after the trial period, while Option A has a rate of change of \$0 per additional month after the trial period.
Then, ask students how they went about graphing the functions. Students are likely to have plotted some input-output pairs of each function. If no students mention identifying the slope and vertical intercept of each graph, ask them about it.
Invite previously selected groups to share how they solved the last question. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.
Connect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions, such as:
“How did the console price show up in your work of finding the number of months Elena could get for \$280?” (It is the constant 250 in the function. I subtracted that from the budgeted \$280 to see that there is \$30 left for additional months.)
“How would these methods change if Elena had budgeted \$300?” (I would replace the 280 with 300 in my equation and solve the new equation for \(x\).)
“Why is the graph of \(A(x)\) a horizontal line?” (\(A(x)\) is the output of function \(A\) and is represented by vertical values on a coordinate plane. The vertical values are typically labeled with the variable \(y\), so we can write \(y = A(x)\) and graph \(y = 600\) to represent function \(A\).)
“How can we see the slope and intercept of the graph of Option B in the function?” (\(B(x)\)  is the output of function \(B\) and is represented by vertical values on a plane. We can write \(y = B(x)\) or \(y = 10x+250\) to see that the slope is 10 and the \(y\)-intercept is 250.)
If time permits, invite students to share which option they believe Elena should choose and why.
