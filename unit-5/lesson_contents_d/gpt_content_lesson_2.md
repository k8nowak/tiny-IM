### Activity 0 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

**Main Insight from the Activity:**\n\nStudents learned that clearly communicating about functions requires precise language. They realized that without specifying which function or day they are discussing, their answers can be ambiguous. The activity highlighted the challenge of being specific while also recognizing that this can lead to lengthy explanations. They will explore a more concise way to describe functions in future lessons.

## Activity 1: A Handy Notation





----------------------------------------

### Activity 1 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned that function notation is a concise way to communicate about functions and their characteristics. They practiced interpreting and using this notation to describe relationships, such as a dog's distance from a post over time. They realized how to express specific points on a graph using function names like \\(f\\), \\(g\\), and \\(h\\) and understood the importance of clarity in describing inputs and outputs in context.

Activity 1 Title: A Handy Notation

Activity 1 Timing: 15 mins

Activity 1 Narrative: In this activity, students learn that function notation can be used as a handy shorthand for communicating about functions and specific parts or features of a function. They interpret statements that are written in this notation and use the notation to refer to points on a graph or to represent simple verbal statements about a function.

Activity 1 Launch: Explain to students that one way to talk about functions precisely and without wordy descriptions is by naming the functions and using function notation.
Suppose we give a name to each function that relates the dog’s distance from the post and the time since the dog owner left: function \(f\) for Day 1, function \(g\) for Day 2, function \(h\) for Day 3. The input of each function is time in seconds, \(t\).
To represent “the distance of the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left,” we can simply write \(f(60)\). To express the same quantity for the second and third day, we can write \(g(60)\) and \(h(60)\).
Ask students to refer to the three graphs from the Warm-up to answer the questions.
Use Critique, Correct, Clarify to give students an opportunity to improve a sample written response by correcting errors, clarifying meaning, and adding details.
Display this first draft:	“\(f(15)\) is the function when the input is 15.” 	Ask, “What parts of this response are unclear, incorrect, or incomplete?” As students respond, annotate the display with 2–3 ideas to indicate the parts of the writing that could use improvement.
Give students 2–4 minutes to work with a partner to revise the first draft.
Display and review these criteria: 	Identify the input and outputReference parts of the situation (distance, day, time since the owner left, units) as part of the description whenever possible
Identify the input and output
Reference parts of the situation (distance, day, time since the owner left, units) as part of the description whenever possible
Select 1–2 individuals or groups to read their revised draft aloud slowly enough to record for all to see. Scribe as each student shares, then invite the whole class to contribute additional language and edits to make the final draft even more clear and more convincing.

Activity 1 Task Statement: Let’s name the functions that relate the dog’s distance from the post and the time since its owner left: function \(f\) for Day 1, function \(g\) for Day 2, function \(h\) for Day 3. The input of each function is time in seconds, \(t\).
Use function notation to complete the table.	day 1day 2day 3a. distance from post 60 seconds after the owner leftb. distance from post when the owner leftc. distance from post 160 seconds after the owner left
 | day 1 | day 2 | day 3
a. distance from post 60 seconds after the owner left |  |  | 
b. distance from post when the owner left |  |  | 
c. distance from post 160 seconds after the owner left |  |  | 
Describe what each expression represents in this context:\(f(15)\)\(g(48)\)\(h(t)\)
Describe what each expression represents in this context:
\(f(15)\)
\(g(48)\)
\(h(t)\)
The equation \(g(120) = 4\) can be interpreted to mean: “On Day 2, 120 seconds after the dog owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.” What does each equation mean in this situation?\(h(40) = 4.6\)\(f(t) = 5\)\(g(t) = d\)
The equation \(g(120) = 4\) can be interpreted to mean: “On Day 2, 120 seconds after the dog owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.”
What does each equation mean in this situation?
\(h(40) = 4.6\)
\(f(t) = 5\)
\(g(t) = d\)

Activity 1 Synthesis: Invite students to share their responses. As students begin to share, they may be unsure of how to express the notation orally. Explain that the expression \(f(60)\) is read "\(f\) of 60," \(g(160)\) is read "\(g\) of 160," and \(h(t)\) is read "\(h\) of \(t\)."
To make sure students see the structure of this new notation, consider displaying it and annotating each part, as shown here.
Image description: <p>Function notation, annotated.</p>
Clarify that:
The notation \(f(x)\) is read “\(f\) of \(x\).” It tells us that \(f\) is the name of the function, \(x\) is the input of the function, and \(f(x)\) is the output, or the value, of the function when the input is \(x\).
The statement \(g(t) = d\) is read: “\(g\) of \(t\) is equal to \(d\).” It tells us that \(g\) is the name of the function and \(t\) is the input. It also tells us that \(g(t)\) is the output, or the value, of the function at \(t\) and \(g(t)\) has the same value as \(d\).

## Activity 2: Birthdays





----------------------------------------

### Activity 2 Takeaways





----------------------------------------

In this activity, students learned that a function gives a unique output for each input. They explored two rules: Rule \\(B\\) (inputting a name gives one birthday) is a function, while Rule \\(P\\) (inputting a date may yield multiple people) is not. This highlights the importance of unique inputs and outputs in defining functions. Students also discussed the use of function notation and recognized that multiple individuals with the same name can complicate the definition of a function.

Activity 2 Title: Birthdays

Activity 2 Timing: 10 mins

Activity 2 Narrative: This activity reinforces students’ understanding about what makes a relationship between two variables a function—namely, that it gives a unique output for each input. It also prompts students to use function notation to express a functional relationship that does not involve numerical values for its input and output.

Activity 2 Launch: 

Activity 2 Task Statement: Rule \(B\) takes a person’s name as its input and gives their birthday as the output.
input | output
Abraham Lincoln | February 12
 | 
 | 
 | 
Rule \(P\) takes a date as its input and gives a person with that birthday as the output.
input | output
August 26 | Katherine Johnson
 | 
 | 
 | 
Complete each table with three more examples of input-output pairs.
If you use your name as the input to \(B\), how many outputs are possible? Explain how you know.
If you use your birthday as the input to \(P\), how many outputs are possible? Explain how you know.
Only one of the two relationships is a function. The other is not a function. Which one is which? Explain how you know.
For the relationship that is a function, write two input-output pairs from the table using function notation.

Activity 2 Synthesis: Discuss with students:
“Why is \(B\) a function, but \(P\) isn’t?” (Each input for \(B\) has a unique output, while inputs for \(P\) may have several outputs. For example, March 14 is the birthday of Albert Einstein, Stephen Curry, Billy Crystal, Simone Biles, and many other people. February 12 is the birthday of Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin.)
“Would it be acceptable to express the rule \(P\) using function notation, for instance, \(P(\text{August 26})= \text{Katherine Johnson}\)? Why or why not?” (No. This notation is reserved for functions, and the input August 26 has many outputs, including mathematician Katherine Johnson, chemist Antoine Lavoisier, and many others.)
Some students might wonder if \(B\) is still a function if multiple people have the same name. For instance, there might be a few people named Katherine Johnson, and if we enter “Katherine Johnson” as the input for \(B\), we would likely get different birthdays for the output.
Acknowledge that this is true, and that \(B\) would only be a function if it assumes that no two people have the same full name, or if another identifier could be used to tell apart people with the same first name and last name (for instance, if a middle name or initial is also used or if a number is added to each Katherine Johnson to distinguish them from one another).
