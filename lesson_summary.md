## What Students Do

**Generating Prompt:**

```

Being as concise as possible, summarize what students do in this lesson in one sentence. Only include the really key essential stuff that is the core of the lesson. Do not include any nice-to-knows or side quests. Really encapsulate it into a super brief description. Eliminate any redundant or unnecessary words. For example, this might look like: 'in groups of 4, plan a pizza party and estimate the costs'. Here are the contents of the lesson: 

```



----------------------------------------

### Providing the whole lesson

**First Version:**

Students analyze relationships to determine if they are functions by identifying independent and dependent variables, and then represent these relationships using tables and graphs.



----------------------------------------

**Shortened Version:**

Students analyze relationships to see if they are functions. They identify independent and dependent variables. Then they represent these relationships with tables and graphs.



----------------------------------------

### Providing just the lesson narrative and lesson synthesis

**First Version:**

Students identify and analyze relationships to determine if they are functions by exploring input-output pairs using tables and graphs in real-life contexts.



----------------------------------------

**Shortened Version:**

Students examine input-output pairs in tables and graphs to identify functions.



----------------------------------------

### Note from Kate

I also tried providing just the activities, but the results were consistently bad.

## What Students Learn

**Generating Prompt:**

```

Being as concise as possible, rewrite these learning goals in plain, everyday language. Keep it super pithy: Do not use verbs like 'Recognize that...' or 'Understand that...', or 'Learn how to...' just start the goal with 'that' or 'to'. You can combine two goals into one if they are similar. Format your response as a numbered list using the formatting (1), (2), etc.

```



----------------------------------------

### Providing Learning Goals

(1) That a function has one output for each input in a relationship between two quantities.  <br>(2) To interpret and describe functions using words and graphs, including identifying independent and dependent variables.



----------------------------------------

**Shortened Version:**

(1) A function has one output for each input.  <br>(2) Describe functions with words and graphs; identify variables.



----------------------------------------

### Providing Learning Targets

(1) That a relationship between two quantities is a function and can be described with graphs and explanations.  <br>(2) To identify independent and dependent variables and represent functions with words and graphs.



----------------------------------------

**Shortened Version:**

(1) A relationship is a function, shown with graphs.  <br>(2) Identify independent and dependent variables; represent functions graphically.



----------------------------------------

## Where It Fits

**Generating Prompt:**

```

Being as concise as possible, describe where this lesson fits in the larger, multi-day instructional unit. Use plain, everyday language. Your response should be a sentence fragment with no subject. For example, your response might look like: 'as a reminder of expressions, equations, and inequalities; as an introduction to modeling.'

```



----------------------------------------

### Providing Lesson Narrative:

as an introduction to functions and their representations; as a foundation for analyzing relationships in problem contexts; as a connection to real-life applications of functions.



----------------------------------------

**Shortened Version:**

Introduction to functions and their representations.  \nFoundation for analyzing relationships in problems.  \nConnection to real-life applications of functions.



----------------------------------------



**Shortening Prompt:**

```

Rewrite this copy. Use plain everyday language and make it absolutely as concise as possible while retaining critical meaning. Ruthlessly delete words that aren't absolutely necessary. Any sentence or component should be maximum ten words. If the input contains any formatting, keep the same style of formatting.
