Features of Graphs
Lesson Narrative
In this lesson, students use the term maximum (or minimum) to talk about the value of a function that is greater than or equal to (or less than or equal to) all the other values. They also use the terms horizontal intercept and vertical intercept to describe the points where a graph crosses the horizontal and vertical axes. Students also interpret graphs more holistically using the terms increasing and decreasing to describe where a function’s values get greater or lesser as the graph is read left to right.
Students relate these features of graphs to features of the functions represented. For instance, they look at an interval in which a graph shows a positive slope and interpret that to mean an interval in which the function’s values are increasing. Students also use statements in function notation, such as \(h(0)\) and \(h(t)=0\), to talk about key features of a graph.
By now, students are familiar with the idea of intercepts. Note that in these materials, the terms “horizontal intercept” and “vertical intercept” are used to refer to intercepts more generally, especially when a function is defined using variables other than \(x\) and \(y\). If needed, clarify these terms for students who may be accustomed to using only the terms “\(x\)-intercept” and “\(y\)-intercept.”
As students look for connections across representations of functions and relate them to quantities in situations, they practice making sense of problems (MP1) and reasoning quantitatively and abstractly (MP2). Using mathematical terms and notation to describe features of graphs and features of functions calls for attention to precision (MP6).
Learning Goals
Interpret key features of a graph—the intercepts, maximums, minimums, and intervals when the function is increasing or decreasing—in terms of a situation.
Analyze connections between statements that use function notation and features of graphs and describe (orally and in writing) these connections.
Understand and be able to use the terms “horizontal intercept,” “vertical intercept,” “maximum,” and “minimum” when talking about graphs of functions.
Student-Facing Goal
Let’s use graphs of functions to learn about situations.
Student-Facing Targets

Glossary
maximum (of a function)
A maximum of a function is a value of the function that is greater than or equal to all the other values. The maximum of the function’s graph is the highest point on the graph.
minimum (of a function)
A minimum of a function is a value of the function that is less than or equal to all the other values. The minimum of the function’s graph is the lowest point on the graph.
decreasing (function)
A function is decreasing if its outputs get smaller as the inputs get larger. This results in a downward sloping graph as it goes from left to right. A function can also be decreasing just for a restricted range of inputs.
This graph shows the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=3−x^2\). It is decreasing for \(x \geq 0\) because the graph slopes downward to the right of the vertical axis.
increasing (function)
A function is increasing if its outputs get larger as the inputs get larger. This results in an upward sloping graph as it goes from left to right. A function can also be increasing just for a restricted range of inputs.
This graph shows the function \(f\) given by \(f(x)=3−x^2\). It is increasing for \(x \leq 0\) because the graph slopes upward to the left of the vertical axis.
vertical intercept
A vertical intercept of a graph is a point where the graph crosses the vertical axis. If the axis is labeled with the variable \(y\), a vertical intercept is also called a \(y\)-intercept. The term can also refer to only the \(y\)-coordinate of the point where the graph crosses the vertical axis.
For example, the vertical intercept of the graph of \(y=3x−5\) is \((0,\text{-}5)\), or just -5.
horizontal intercept
A horizontal intercept of a graph is a point where the graph crosses the horizontal axis. If the axis is labeled with the variable \(x\), a horizontal intercept is also called an \(x\)-intercept. The term can also refer to only the \(x\)-coordinate of the point where the graph crosses the horizontal axis.
For example, the horizontal intercept of the graph of \(2x+4y=12\) is \((6,0)\), or just 6.

Warm-up
Walking Home
Activity Narrative
This Warm-up is an opportunity to practice interpreting statements in function notation. It also draws attention to statements that correspond to the intercepts of a graph of a function (for instance, \(d(0)\) and \(d(m) = 0\)), preparing students to reason about them in the lesson (particularly in the second activity).
Launch
Activity
Student Task Statement
Diego is walking home from school at a constant rate. This graph represents function \(d\), which gives his distance from home, in kilometers, \(m\) minutes since leaving the school.
Use the graph to find or estimate:
\(d(0)\)
\(d(12)\)
the solution to \(d(m)=1\)
the solution to \(d(m)=0\)
Image description: <p>Graph of line. Horizontal axis, 0 to 24 by 4’s, minutes since leaving school. Vertical axis, 0 to 3 by point 5’s, kilometers from home. Line starts at about 0 comma 2 point 2 5, and ends at 20 comma 0.</p>
Activity Synthesis
Ask students to interpret each statement in function notation before soliciting their response to each question. Make sure students understand, for instance, that \(d(0)\) represents Diego’s distance from school at the time of leaving (or at 0 minutes) and \(d(m)=0\) represents his distance from home being 0 km, \(m\) minutes after leaving school.
If time permits, discuss with students:
“Is the relationship between time and Diego’s distance from school a linear function? How can we tell?” (Yes. The graph is a line, which means the function’s value changes at a constant rate.)
“Can we tell from the graph how far away Diego’s house is from school? How?” (Yes. From the graph, we can see that at the time he leaves school, he is 2.25 km from home.)
“Can we tell from the graph how long it took Diego to get home? How?” (Yes. From the graph, we can see the distance reaching 0 km when the time is 20 minutes.)
“Why does the graph slant downward (or have a negative slope)?” (As the input, \(m\), increases, the output, \(d(m)\), decreases.)

Activity
A Toy Rocket and a Drone
Activity Narrative
In this activity, students examine graphs of functions, identify and describe their key features, and connect these features to the situations represented. These key features include the horizontal and vertical intercepts, maximums and minimums, and intervals in which a function is increasing or decreasing (or where a graph has a positive or a negative slope).
Neither the features nor the terms are likely new to students. The idea of intercepts was introduced in middle school and further developed in earlier units. Graphical features such as maximums and minimums have been considered intuitively in various cases. They are simply more precisely defined here. In a later activity, students will distinguish between a maximum of a graph and the maximum of a function.
Launch
Give students about 5 minutes of quiet work time. Follow with a whole-class discussion.
Arrange students in groups of 2. Introduce the context of toy drones and rockets. Use Co-Craft Questions to orient students to the context and elicit possible mathematical questions.
Display only the problem stem and related graph, without revealing the questions. Give students 1–2 minutes to write a list of mathematical questions that could be asked about the situation before comparing questions with a partner.
Invite several partners to share one question with the class, and record responses. Ask the class to make comparisons among the shared questions and their own. Ask, “What do these questions have in common? How are they different?” Listen for and amplify language related to the learning goal, such as “increasing,” “decreasing,” “maximum,” or “hit the ground.”
Reveal the questions and give students 1–2 minutes to compare it to their own question and those of their classmates. Invite students to similarities and differences by asking:	“Which of your questions is similar to or different from the ones provided?”“Is there a main mathematical concept that is present in both your questions and those provided? If so, describe it.”
“Which of your questions is similar to or different from the ones provided?”

Activity
Student Task Statement
A toy rocket and a drone were launched at the same time.
Here are the graphs that represent the heights of the two objects as a function of time since they were launched.
Height is measured in meters above the ground, and time is measured in seconds since launch.
2 graphs. Horizontal axis, 0 to 7, time in seconds. Vertical axis, 0 to 50 by 10’s, height in meters. Graph R is parabolic and opens down. It starts at 0 comma 25. Its vertex is at 2 comma 45. It ends at 5 comma 0. Graph D is piecewise linear. It starts at 0 comma 0. Increases until 2 comma 20, horizontal until 5 comma 20, then decreases to 7 comma 0.
Image description: <p>2 graphs. Horizontal axis, 0 to 7, time in seconds. Vertical axis, 0 to 50 by 10’s, height in meters. Graph R is a parabolic and opens down. Graph D is piecewise linear.</p>
Analyze the graphs and describe—as precisely as you can—what was happening with each object. ​​Your descriptions should be complete and precise enough that someone who is not looking at the graph could visualize how the objects were behaving.
Which parts or features of the graphs show important information about each object’s movement? List the features, or mark them on the graphs.
When analyzing the graphs and describing what is happening with each object, some students may mistakenly think that the horizontal axis represents horizontal distance, neglecting to notice that it represents time. They may then describe how the objects were moving vertically as they traveled horizontally, rather than with respect to the number of seconds since they took off. Encourage these students to check the label of each axis and revisit their descriptions.
Activity Synthesis
Select a few students to share their description of the graphs, and have each student describe the motion of one flying object.
Display a blank coordinate plane for all to see. As each student shares their response, sketch a graph to match what is being described.
Image description: <p>Blank graph. time in seconds and height in meters.</p>
For any gaps in their description, make assumptions and sketch accordingly. (For example, if a student states that the toy rocket reaches a height of 45 meters after 2 seconds but does not state its starting height, start the curve at \((0,0)\), \((0,40)\), or any other point besides \((0,25)\).) If requested, allow students to refine their descriptions and adjust the sketch accordingly.
Next, invite other students to share their response to the last question. On the graphs, highlight the features students noted. (See Student Response for an example.) Use the terms “vertical intercepts,” “horizontal intercepts,” “maximum,” and “minimum” to refer to those features, and label them on the graphs.
Explain to students that:
A point on the graph that is as high as or higher than all other points is called a maximum of the graph (or a relative maximum, because its height is viewed in relation to other points shown on the graph).
A point on the graph that is as low as or lower than all other points is called a minimum of the graph (or a relative minimum).
A graph could have more than one relative maximum or minimum. For instance, the points \((2,(D(2))\) and \((5,D(5)\)) are both relative maximums, and \((0, D(0))\) and \((7,D(7))\) are both relative minimums.
If no students mentioned the intervals in which each function was increasing, staying constant, or decreasing, draw their attention to these features on the graphs and label them as such.

The Jump
Activity Narrative
Earlier in the lesson, students identified key features of a graph of a function and related them to the features of a situation. In this activity, students continue to connect graphical and verbal representations of a function, applying the mathematical terms they learned. They also connect each feature (described in words and on the graph) to an expression or equation that could represent it mathematically, written in function notation.
During the Activity Synthesis, students learn to distinguish between a maximum or minimum of a graph (relative maximum or minimum) and the maximum or minimum of a function (absolute maximum or minimum). Students see that a maximum of a graph refers to a point on a graph that is as high as or higher than all other points, while the maximum of a function is a function value that is equal to or greater than all other values of that function.
Launch
Arrange students in groups of 2. Give students a few minutes of quiet think time and then time to discuss their response with their partner.
The history of bungee jumping goes back to a practice used by the people of Pentecost Island in Vanuatu. Ask students if they have ever been bungee jumping or seen a video of someone doing it. If necessary, describe the activity as one in which a person jumps from a tall platform connected to the platform by a very strong but elastic cord (similar to a super-strong rubber band). Ask students to show with their hands what a person’s height might look like after bungee jumping off the platform.
Activity
Student Task Statement
In a bungee jump, the height of the jumper is a function of time since the jump begins.
Function \(h\) defines the height, in meters, of a jumper above a river, \(t\) seconds since leaving the platform.
Here is a graph of function \(h\), followed by five expressions or equations and five graphical features.

Match each description about the jump to a corresponding expression or equation and to a feature on the graph.One expression or equation does not have a matching verbal description. Its corresponding graphical feature is also not shown on the graph. Interpret that expression or equation in terms of the jump, and describe the feature of the graph it represents.

Match each description about the jump to a corresponding expression or equation and to a feature on the graph.
One expression or equation does not have a matching verbal description. Its corresponding graphical feature is also not shown on the graph.

Use the graph to:estimate \(h(0)\) and \(h(4)\)estimate the solutions to \(h(t)=45\) and \(h(t) = 0\)
Use the graph to:

estimate the solutions to \(h(t)=45\) and \(h(t) = 0\)
Based on the information available, how long do you think the bungee cord is? Make an estimate, and explain your reasoning.
Activity Synthesis
Select students to share how they made their matches and how they interpreted the expression or equation without a matching verbal description. After each student shares their thinking, ask if others also approached it the same way.
Make sure students can interpret \(h(t)=0\) to mean that the jumper is no longer in the air and is in fact on the surface of the water. Because the graph has no horizontal intercept, and because no verbal descriptions to this effect were given, we know \(h(t)=0\) has no match.
Next, ask students to share their response to the last set of questions. Discuss with students why \(h(t)=0\) has no solutions based on the information we have. It is possible that, if the graph is extended to include more time, we might see a representation of the jumper somehow reaching the water. But given the graph as is, it doesn’t have a solution.
This is a good time to introduce the distinction between a maximum (or minimum) of a graph and the maximum (or minimum) of a function. Ask students,
“What is the greatest value of function \(h\)?” (80)
“How do we know that 80 is the greatest, or that \(h(t)\) could not have greater values?” (The jumper could not be higher than the jumping platform.)
“What is the least value of function \(h\)?” (about 10, based on the graph)
“How do we know that 10 is the least value, or that \(h(t)\) could not have lesser values?” (We don’t. The jumper could go lower, say, if lowered into a receiving boat or if released into the river.)
Explain that in this case, the graph has one maximum, or one point that is higher than all the other points, and it coincides with the maximum of the function, which is the greatest value of the function.
The graph also has a minimum, \((4, h(4))\), which is lower than all other points shown on the graph, but this point does not represent the minimum of the function, or the lowest value the function could have. The function \(h\) could have 0 as its minimum (or a negative value if the jumper goes diving), but as far as the given graph is concerned, \((4,10)\) is a minimum.
Emphasize that a maximum (or minimum) of a graph is a point, and it gets labeled as such relative to other points visible on the graph. The maximum (or minimum) of a function, however, is a value that is the greatest (or least) for any input.
Lesson Synthesis
Keep students in groups of 2. Display the graph and two possible descriptions of functions that could be represented by the graph for all students to see:
Image description: <p>Nonlinear graph. time in seconds and distance in feet.</p>
Function \(b\) gives the vertical distance (or the height) of a bee from the ground as a function of time, \(t\).
Function \(d\) gives the distance of a child from where his mom is sitting as a function of time, \(t\).
Tell students that the outputs of both functions are measured in feet and the inputs are both measured in seconds.
Ask partners to choose a function. For that function, they should take turns identifying the following features on the graph and interpreting them in terms of the situations:
vertical intercept
horizontal intercept
maximum
minimum
intervals in which the function is increasing
intervals in which the function is decreasing
intervals in which the function is staying constant
solution or solutions to \(b(t) = 3.5\) or \(d(t) = 3.5\)
Then, discuss questions such as:
“How can you tell that a point on the graph is a maximum, a minimum, or neither?” (Look to the left and to the right of it to see whether the given point is higher than all the other points, lower than all the others, or neither.)
“How many intercepts can the graph of a function have?” (There is an unlimited number on the horizontal axis, but only one on the vertical axis.)
Student Lesson Summary
The graph of the function can give us useful information about the quantities in a situation. Some points and features of a graph are particularly informative, so we pay closer attention to them.
Let’s look at the graph of function \(h\), which gives the height, in meters, of a ball \(t\) seconds after it is tossed up in the air. From the graph, we can see that:
The point \((0,20)\) is the vertical intercept of the graph, or the point where the graph intersects the vertical axis.This point tells us that the initial height of the ball is 20 meters, because when \(t\) is 0, the value of \(h(t)\) is 20​​​​​.The statement \(h(0)=20\) captures this information.
The point \((0,20)\) is the vertical intercept of the graph, or the point where the graph intersects the vertical axis.
This point tells us that the initial height of the ball is 20 meters, because when \(t\) is 0, the value of \(h(t)\) is 20​​​​​.
The statement \(h(0)=20\) captures this information.
Image description: <p>Graph of curve. Horizontal axis, 0 to 4, time, seconds. Vertical axis, 0 to 25 by 5’s, height, meters. Curve goes through labeled point 0 comma 20, 1 comma 25, and 3 point 2 comma 0.</p>
The point \((1,25)\) is the highest point on the graph, so it is a maximum of the graph.The value 25 is also the maximum value of the function \(h\). It tells us that the highest point the ball reaches is 25 meters, and that this happens 1 second after the ball is tossed.
The point \((1,25)\) is the highest point on the graph, so it is a maximum of the graph.
The value 25 is also the maximum value of the function \(h\). It tells us that the highest point the ball reaches is 25 meters, and that this happens 1 second after the ball is tossed.
The point \((3.2,0)\) is a horizontal intercept of the graph, a point where the graph intersects the horizontal axis. This point is also the lowest point on the graph, so it represents a minimum of the graph.This point tells us that the ball hits the ground 3.2 seconds after being tossed up, so the height of the ball is 0 when \(t\) is 3.2, which we can write as \(h(3.2)=0\). Because \(h\) cannot have any lower value, 0 is also the minimum value of the function.
The point \((3.2,0)\) is a horizontal intercept of the graph, a point where the graph intersects the horizontal axis. This point is also the lowest point on the graph, so it represents a minimum of the graph.
This point tells us that the ball hits the ground 3.2 seconds after being tossed up, so the height of the ball is 0 when \(t\) is 3.2, which we can write as \(h(3.2)=0\). Because \(h\) cannot have any lower value, 0 is also the minimum value of the function.
The height of the graph increases when \(t\) is between 0 and 1. (A graph is increasing where the function’s values get greater as the graph is read left to right.) Then, the graph changes direction, and the height decreases when \(t\) is between 1 and 3.2. (A graph is decreasing where the function’s values get lesser as the graph is read left to right.) Neither the increasing part nor the decreasing part is a straight line.This suggests that the ball increases in height in the first second after being tossed and then starts falling between 1 second and 3.2 seconds. It also tells us that the height does not increase or decrease at a constant rate.

Because the intercepts of a graph are points on an axis, at least one of their coordinates is 0. The 0 corresponds to the input or the output of a function, or both.
A vertical intercept is on the vertical axis, so its coordinates have the form \((0,b)\), where the first coordinate is 0 and \(b\) can be any number. The 0 is the input.
A horizontal intercept is on the horizontal axis, so its coordinates have the form \((a, 0)\), where \(a\) can be any number and the second coordinate is 0. The 0 is an output.
A graph that passes through \((0,0)\) intersects both axes so that point is both a horizontal intercept and a vertical intercept. Both the input and output are 0.
