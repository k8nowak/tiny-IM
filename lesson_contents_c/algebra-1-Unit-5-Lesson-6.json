    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students use the term maximum (or minimum) to talk about the value of a function that is greater than or equal to (or less than or equal to) all the other values. They also use the terms horizontal intercept and vertical intercept to describe the points where a graph crosses the horizontal and vertical axes. Students also interpret graphs more holistically using the terms increasing and decreasing to describe where a function\u2019s values get greater or lesser as the graph is read left to right.\nStudents relate these features of graphs to features of the functions represented. For instance, they look at an interval in which a graph shows a positive slope and interpret that to mean an interval in which the function\u2019s values are increasing. Students also use statements in function notation, such as \\(h(0)\\) and \\(h(t)=0\\), to talk about key features of a graph.\nBy now, students are familiar with the idea of intercepts. Note that in these materials, the terms \u201chorizontal intercept\u201d and \u201cvertical intercept\u201d are used to refer to intercepts more generally, especially when a function is defined using variables other than \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). If needed, clarify these terms for students who may be accustomed to using only the terms \u201c\\(x\\)-intercept\u201d and \u201c\\(y\\)-intercept.\u201d\nAs students look for connections across representations of functions and relate them to quantities in situations, they practice making sense of problems (MP1) and reasoning quantitatively and abstractly (MP2). Using mathematical terms and notation to describe features of graphs and features of functions calls for attention to precision (MP6).",

      "maximum (of a function)": "A maximum of a function is a value of the function that is greater than or equal to all the other values. The maximum of the function\u2019s graph is the highest point on the graph.",
      "minimum (of a function)": "A minimum of a function is a value of the function that is less than or equal to all the other values. The minimum of the function\u2019s graph is the lowest point on the graph.",
      "decreasing (function)": "A function is decreasing if its outputs get smaller as the inputs get larger. This results in a downward sloping graph as it goes from left to right. A function can also be decreasing just for a restricted range of inputs.\nThis graph shows the function \\(f\\)\u00a0given by \\(f(x)=3\u2212x^2\\). It is decreasing for \\(x \\geq 0\\) because the graph slopes downward to the right of the vertical axis.",
      "increasing (function)": "A function is increasing if its outputs get larger as the inputs get larger. This results in an upward sloping graph as it goes from left to right. A function can also be increasing just for a restricted range of inputs.\nThis graph shows the function \\(f\\) given by \\(f(x)=3\u2212x^2\\). It is increasing for \\(x \\leq 0\\) because the graph slopes upward to the left of the vertical axis.",
      "vertical intercept": "A vertical intercept of a graph is a point where the graph crosses the vertical axis. If the axis is labeled with the variable \\(y\\), a vertical intercept is also called a \\(y\\)-intercept. The term can also refer to only the \\(y\\)-coordinate of the point where the graph crosses the vertical axis.\nFor example, the vertical intercept of the graph of \\(y=3x\u22125\\) is \\((0,\\text{-}5)\\), or just -5.",
      "horizontal intercept": "A horizontal intercept of a graph is a point where the graph crosses the horizontal axis. If the axis is labeled with the variable \\(x\\), a horizontal intercept is also called an \\(x\\)-intercept. The term can also refer to only the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point where the graph crosses the horizontal axis.\nFor example, the horizontal intercept of the graph of \\(2x+4y=12\\) is \\((6,0)\\), or just 6."

How can we tell?\u201d (Yes. The graph is a line, which means the function\u2019s value changes at a constant rate.)\n\u201cCan we tell from the graph how far away Diego\u2019s house is from school? How?\u201d (Yes. From the graph, we can see that at the time he leaves school, he is 2.25 km from home.)\n\u201cCan we tell from the graph how long it took Diego to get home? How?\u201d (Yes.

These key features include the horizontal and vertical intercepts, maximums and minimums, and intervals in which a function is increasing or decreasing (or where a graph has a positive or a negative slope).\nNeither the features nor the terms are likely new to students. The idea of intercepts was introduced in middle school and further developed in earlier units. Graphical features such as maximums and minimums have been considered intuitively in various cases. They are simply more precisely defined here. In a later activity, students will distinguish between a maximum of a graph and the maximum of a function.",

List the features, or mark them on the graphs.",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "When analyzing the graphs and describing what is happening with each object, some students may mistakenly think that the horizontal axis represents horizontal distance, neglecting to notice that it represents time. They may then describe how the objects were moving vertically as they traveled horizontally, rather than with respect to the number of seconds since they took off. Encourage these students to check the label of each axis and revisit their descriptions.",

(For example, if a student states that the toy rocket reaches a height of 45 meters after 2 seconds but does not state its starting height, start the curve at \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,40)\\), or any other point besides \\((0,25)\\).) If requested, allow students to refine their descriptions and adjust the sketch accordingly.\nNext, invite other students to share their response to the last question. On the graphs, highlight the features students noted. (See Student Response for an example.) Use the terms \u201cvertical intercepts,\u201d \u201chorizontal intercepts,\u201d \u201cmaximum,\u201d and \u201cminimum\u201d to refer to those features, and label them on the graphs.\nExplain to students that:\nA point on the graph that is as high as or higher than all other points is called a maximum of the graph (or a relative maximum, because its height is viewed in relation to other points shown on the graph).\nA point on the graph that is as low as or lower than all other points is called a minimum of the graph (or a relative minimum).\nA graph could have more than one relative maximum or minimum. For instance, the points \\((2,(D(2))\\) and \\((5,D(5)\\)) are both relative maximums, and \\((0, D(0))\\) and \\((7,D(7))\\) are both relative minimums.\nIf no students mentioned the intervals in which each function was increasing, staying constant, or decreasing, draw their attention to these features on the graphs and label them as such."

In this activity, students continue to connect graphical and verbal representations of a function, applying the mathematical terms they learned. They also connect each feature (described in words and on the graph) to an expression or equation that could represent it mathematically, written in function notation.\nDuring the Activity Synthesis, students learn to distinguish between a maximum or minimum of a graph (relative maximum or minimum) and the maximum or minimum of a function (absolute maximum or minimum).

After each student shares their thinking, ask if others also approached it the same way.\nMake sure students can interpret \\(h(t)=0\\) to mean that the jumper is no longer in the air and is in fact on the surface of the water. Because the graph has no horizontal intercept, and because no verbal descriptions to this effect were given, we know \\(h(t)=0\\) has no match.\nNext, ask students to share their response to the last set of questions. Discuss with students why \\(h(t)=0\\) has no solutions based on the information we have. It is possible that, if the graph is extended to include more time, we might see a representation of the jumper somehow reaching the water. But given the graph as is, it doesn\u2019t have a solution.\nThis is a good time to introduce the distinction between a maximum (or minimum) of a graph and the maximum (or minimum) of a function. Ask students,\n\u201cWhat is the greatest value of function \\(h\\)?\u201d (80)\n\u201cHow do we know that 80 is the greatest, or that \\(h(t)\\) could not have greater values?\u201d (The jumper could not be higher than the jumping platform.)\n\u201cWhat is the least value of function \\(h\\)?\u201d (about 10, based on the graph)\n\u201cHow do we know that 10 is the least value, or that \\(h(t)\\) could not have lesser values?\u201d (We don\u2019t. The jumper could go lower, say, if lowered into a receiving boat\u00a0or if released into the river.)\nExplain that\u00a0in this case, the graph has one maximum, or one point that is higher than all the other points, and it coincides with the maximum of the function, which is the greatest value of the function.\nThe graph also has a minimum, \\((4, h(4))\\), which is lower than all other points shown on the graph, but this point does not represent the minimum of the function, or the lowest value the function could have. The function \\(h\\) could have 0 as its minimum (or a negative value if the jumper goes diving), but as far as the given graph is concerned, \\((4,10)\\) is a minimum.\nEmphasize that a maximum (or minimum) of a graph is a point, and it gets labeled as such relative to other points visible on the graph. The maximum (or minimum) of a function, however, is a value that is the greatest (or least) for any input."

    "Student Lesson Summary": "The graph of the function can give us useful information about the quantities in a situation. Some points and features of a graph are particularly informative, so we pay closer attention to them.\nLet\u2019s look at the graph of function \\(h\\), which gives the height, in meters, of a ball \\(t\\) seconds after it is tossed up in the air. From the graph, we can see that:\nThe point \\((0,20)\\) is the vertical intercept of the graph, or the point where the graph intersects the vertical axis.This point tells us that the initial height of the ball is 20 meters, because when \\(t\\)\u00a0is 0, the value of \\(h(t)\\) is 20\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.The statement \\(h(0)=20\\) captures this information.\nThe point \\((0,20)\\) is the vertical intercept of the graph, or the point where the graph intersects the vertical axis.\nThis point tells us that the initial height of the ball is 20 meters, because when \\(t\\)\u00a0is 0, the value of \\(h(t)\\) is 20\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.\nThe statement \\(h(0)=20\\) captures this information.\nImage description: <p>Graph of curve.

Curve goes through labeled point 0 comma 20, 1 comma 25, and 3 point 2 comma 0.</p>\nThe point \\((1,25)\\) is the highest point on the graph, so it is a maximum of the graph.The value 25 is also the maximum\u00a0value of the function \\(h\\). It tells us that the highest point the ball reaches is 25 meters, and that this happens 1 second after the ball is tossed.\nThe point \\((1,25)\\) is the highest point on the graph, so it is a maximum of the graph.\nThe value 25 is also the maximum\u00a0value of the function \\(h\\). It tells us that the highest point the ball reaches is 25 meters, and that this happens 1 second after the ball is tossed.\nThe point \\((3.2,0)\\) is a horizontal intercept of the graph, a point where the graph intersects the horizontal axis. This point is also the lowest point on the graph, so it represents a minimum of the graph.This point\u00a0tells us that the ball hits the ground 3.2 seconds after being tossed up, so the height of the ball is 0 when \\(t\\) is 3.2, which we can write as\u00a0\\(h(3.2)=0\\). Because \\(h\\) cannot have any lower value, 0 is also the minimum\u00a0value of the function.\nThe point \\((3.2,0)\\) is a horizontal intercept of the graph, a point where the graph intersects the horizontal axis. This point is also the lowest point on the graph, so it represents a minimum of the graph.\nThis point\u00a0tells us that the ball hits the ground 3.2 seconds after being tossed up, so the height of the ball is 0 when \\(t\\) is 3.2, which we can write as\u00a0\\(h(3.2)=0\\). Because \\(h\\) cannot have any lower value, 0 is also the minimum\u00a0value of the function.\nThe height of the graph increases when \\(t\\) is between 0 and 1. (A graph is increasing where the function\u2019s values get greater as the graph is read left to right.) Then, the graph changes direction, and the height decreases when \\(t\\) is between 1 and 3.2. (A graph is decreasing where the function\u2019s values get lesser as the graph is read left to right.) Neither the increasing part nor the decreasing part is a straight line.This suggests that the ball increases in height in the first second after being tossed\u00a0and then starts falling between 1 second and 3.2 seconds. It also tells us that the height does not increase or decrease at a constant rate.\nThe height of the graph increases when \\(t\\) is between 0 and 1. (A graph is increasing where the function\u2019s values get greater as the graph is read left to right.) Then, the graph changes direction, and the height decreases when \\(t\\) is between 1 and 3.2. (A graph is decreasing where the function\u2019s values get lesser as the graph is read left to right.) Neither the increasing part nor the decreasing part is a straight line.\nThis suggests that the ball increases in height in the first second after being tossed\u00a0and then starts falling between 1 second and 3.2 seconds. It also tells us that the height does not increase or decrease at a constant rate.\nBecause the intercepts of a graph are points on an axis, at least one of their coordinates is 0. The 0 corresponds to the input or the output of a function, or both.\nA vertical intercept is on the vertical axis, so its coordinates have the form \\((0,b)\\), where the first coordinate is 0 and \\(b\\) can be any number. The 0 is the input.\nA horizontal intercept is on the horizontal axis, so its coordinates have the form \\((a, 0)\\), where \\(a\\) can be any number and the second coordinate is 0. The 0 is an output.\nA graph that passes through \\((0,0)\\) intersects both axes\u00a0so that point is both a horizontal intercept and a vertical intercept. Both the input and output are 0."
