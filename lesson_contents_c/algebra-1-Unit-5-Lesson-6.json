            "activity_synthesis": "Select students to share how they made their matches and how they interpreted the expression or equation without a matching verbal description. After each student shares their thinking, ask if others also approached it the same way. Make sure students can interpret \\(h(t)=0\\) to mean that the jumper is no longer in the air and is in fact on the surface of the water. Because the graph has no horizontal intercept, and because no verbal descriptions to this effect were given, we know \\(h(t)=0\\) has no match. Next, ask students to share their response to the last set of questions. Discuss with students why \\(h(t)=0\\) has no solutions based on the information we have. It is possible that, if the graph is extended to include more time, we might see a representation of the jumper somehow reaching the water. But given the graph as is, it doesn\u2019t have a solution. This is a good time to introduce the distinction between a maximum (or minimum) of a graph and the maximum (or minimum) of a function. Ask students, \u201cWhat is the greatest value of function \\(h\\)?\u201d (80) \u201cHow do we know that 80 is the greatest, or that \\(h(t)\\) could not have greater values?\u201d (The jumper could not be higher than the jumping platform.) \u201cWhat is the least value of function \\(h\\)?\u201d (about 10, based on the graph) \u201cHow do we know that 10 is the least value, or that \\(h(t)\\) could not have lesser values?\u201d (We don\u2019t. The jumper could go lower, say, if lowered into a receiving boat\u00a0or if released into the river.) Explain that\u00a0in this case, the graph has one maximum, or one point that is higher than all the other points, and it coincides with the maximum of the function, which is the greatest value of the function. The graph also has a minimum, \\((4, h(4))\\), which is lower than all other points shown on the graph, but this point does not represent the minimum of the function, or the lowest value the function could have. The function \\(h\\) could have 0 as its minimum (or a negative value if the jumper goes diving), but as far as the given graph is concerned, \\((4,10)\\) is a minimum. Emphasize that a maximum (or minimum) of a graph is a point, and it gets labeled as such relative to other points visible on the graph. The maximum (or minimum) of a function, however, is a value that is the greatest (or least) for any input. ## Lesson Synthesis Keep students in groups of 2. Display the graph and two possible descriptions of functions that could be represented by the graph for all students to see: Image description: <p>Nonlinear graph. time in seconds and distance in feet.</p> Function \\(b\\) gives the vertical distance (or the height) of a bee from the ground as a function of time, \\(t\\). Function \\(d\\) gives the distance of a child from where his mom is sitting as a function of time, \\(t\\). Tell students that the outputs of both functions are measured in feet and the inputs are both measured in seconds. Ask partners to choose a function. For that function, they should take turns identifying the following features on the graph and interpreting them in terms of the situations: vertical intercept horizontal intercept maximum minimum intervals in which the function is increasing intervals in which the function is decreasing intervals in which the function is staying constant solution or solutions to \\(b(t) = 3.5\\) or \\(d(t) = 3.5\\) Then, discuss questions such as: \u201cHow can you tell that a point on the graph is a maximum, a minimum, or neither?\u201d (Look to the left and to the right of it to see whether the given point is higher than all the other points, lower than all the others, or neither.) \u201cHow many intercepts can the graph of a function have?\u201d (There is an unlimited number on the horizontal axis, but only one on the vertical axis.) ## Student Lesson Summary The graph of the function can give us useful information about the quantities in a situation. Some points and features of a graph are particularly informative, so we pay closer attention to them. Let\u2019s look at the graph of function \\(h\\), which gives the height, in meters, of a ball \\(t\\) seconds after it is tossed up in the air. From the graph, we can see that: The point \\((0,20)\\) is the vertical intercept of the graph, or the point where the graph intersects the vertical axis.This point tells us that the initial height of the ball is 20 meters, because when \\(t\\)\u00a0is 0, the value of \\(h(t)\\) is 20\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.The statement \\(h(0)=20\\) captures this information. The point \\((0,20)\\) is the vertical intercept of the graph, or the point where the graph intersects the vertical axis. This point tells us that the initial height of the ball is 20 meters, because when \\(t\\)\u00a0is 0, the value of \\(h(t)\\) is 20\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The statement \\(h(0)=20\\) captures this information. Image description: <p>Graph of curve. Horizontal axis, 0 to 4, time, seconds. Vertical axis, 0 to 25 by 5\u2019s, height, meters. Curve goes through labeled point 0 comma 20, 1 comma 25, and 3 point 2 comma 0.</p> The point \\((1,25)\\) is the highest point on the graph, so it is a maximum of the graph.The value 25 is also the maximum\u00a0value of the function \\(h\\). It tells us that the highest point the ball reaches is 25 meters, and that this happens 1 second after the ball is tossed. The point \\((1,25)\\) is the highest point on the graph, so it is a maximum of the graph. The value 25 is also the maximum\u00a0value of the function \\(h\\). It tells us that the highest point the ball reaches is 25 meters, and that this happens 1 second after the ball is tossed. The point \\((3.2,0)\\) is a horizontal intercept of the graph, a point where the graph intersects the horizontal axis. This point is also the lowest point on the graph, so it represents a minimum of the graph.This point\u00a0tells us that the ball hits the ground 3.2 seconds after being tossed up, so the height of the ball is 0 when \\(t\\) is 3.2, which we can write as\u00a0\\(h(3.2)=0\\). Because \\(h\\) cannot have any lower value, 0 is also the minimum\u00a0value of the function. The point \\((3.2,0)\\) is a horizontal intercept of the graph, a point where the graph intersects the horizontal axis. This point is also the lowest point on the graph, so it represents a minimum of the graph. This point\u00a0tells us that the ball hits the ground 3.2 seconds after being tossed up, so the height of the ball is 0 when \\(t\\) is 3.2, which we can write as\u00a0\\(h(3.2)=0\\). Because \\(h\\) cannot have any lower value, 0 is also the minimum\u00a0value of the function. The height of the graph increases when \\(t\\) is between 0 and 1. (A graph is increasing where the function\u2019s values get greater as the graph is read left to right.) Then, the graph changes direction, and the height decreases when \\(t\\) is between 1 and 3.2. (A graph is decreasing where the function\u2019s values get lesser as the graph is read left to right.) Neither the increasing part nor the decreasing part is a straight line.This suggests that the ball increases in height in the first second after being tossed\u00a0and then starts falling between 1 second and 3.2 seconds. It also tells us that the height does not increase or decrease at a constant rate. The height of the graph increases when \\(t\\) is between 0 and 1. (A graph is increasing where the function\u2019s values get greater as the graph is read left to right.) Then, the graph changes direction, and the height decreases when \\(t\\) is between 1 and 3.2. (A graph is decreasing where the function\u2019s values get lesser as the graph is read left to right.) Neither the increasing part nor the decreasing part is a straight line. This suggests that the ball increases in height in the first second after being tossed\u00a0and then starts falling between 1 second and 3.2 seconds. It also tells us that the height does not increase or decrease at a constant rate. Because the intercepts of a graph are points on an axis, at least one of their coordinates is 0. The 0 corresponds to the input or the output of a function, or both. A vertical intercept is on the vertical axis, so its coordinates have the form \\((0,b)\\), where the first coordinate is 0 and \\(b\\) can be any number. The 0 is the input. A horizontal intercept is on the horizontal axis, so its coordinates have the form \\((a, 0)\\), where \\(a\\) can be any number and the second coordinate is 0. The 0 is an output. A graph that passes through \\((0,0)\\) intersects both axes\u00a0so that point is both a horizontal intercept and a vertical intercept. Both the input and output are 0.  "
