        "activity_narrative": "The goal of this Warm-up is to motivate the need for a notation that can be used to communicate about functions. Students analyze three graphs from an earlier lesson, interpret various points on the graphs, and use their analyses to answer questions about the situations. This work requires students to make careful connections between points on the graphs, pairs of input and output values, and verbal descriptions of the functions. Students find that\u00a0unless each feature and the function being referred to is clearly articulated, which could be tedious to do, what they wish to communicate about the function\u00a0may be ambiguous or unclear. When answering the last two questions, students are likely to find the prompts lacking in specificity and to probe: \u201cfor which day?\u201d Suggest that they answer based on their interpretation of the questions. Then, look for students who assume that the questions refer to one particular function and those who assume they refer to all three functions (and consequently answer them for each function). Ask them to share their interpretations during the whole-class discussion.",

        "activity_synthesis": "Invite students to share their response to the first set of questions. To help illustrate that it could be tedious to refer to a specific part of a function fully and precisely, ask each question completely for each of the three days. (For instance, \u201cHow far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left on Day 1? How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left on Day 2?\u201d) If students offer a numerical value (for instance, \u201c1.5 feet\u201d) without stating what question it answers or to what quantity it corresponds to, ask them to clarify. Next, select previously identified students to share their responses to the last two questions. Regardless of whether students chose to answer them for a particular day or for all three days, point out that the answers depend on the day. When the day (or the function) is not specified, it is unclear what information is sought. Explain that sometimes we need to be pretty specific when talking about functions. But being specific could require many\u00a0words and become burdensome. Tell students that they will learn about a way to describe functions clearly and succinctly."

Ask partners to take turns reading and interpreting the statements in function notation. Each person should: Read the statement aloud to their partner. Identify the input, the output, and the function in the statement. Explain the meaning of the entire statement using a complete sentence. If students say that the first two statements have no outputs, clarify that both \\(b(2)\\) and \\(b(6)\\) represent outputs, even though the value of each is not stated. ## Student Lesson Summary Here are graphs of two functions, each representing the cost of riding in a taxi from two companies\u2014Friendly Rides and Great Cabs. For each taxi, the cost of a ride is a function of the distance traveled. The input is distance in miles, and the output is cost in dollars. 2 graphs. Horizontal axis, 0 to 7, distance, miles. Vertical axis, 0 to 16 by 4\u2019s, cost, dollars. Dotted graph starts flat, then increases. Passes through 2 comma 4 point 2 5. Solid graph starts flat then increases. Passes through 2 comma 5 point 7. They intersect near 4 point 5 comma 10. Image description: <p>2 graphs. Horizontal axis, 0 to 7, distance, miles. Vertical axis, 0 to 16 by 4\u2019s, cost, dollars. Dotted graph goes through 2 comma 4 point 2 5. Solid graph goes through 2 comma 5 point 7.</p> The point\u00a0\\((2,5.70)\\) on one graph tells\u00a0us the cost of riding a Friendly Rides taxi for 2 miles. The point \\((2, 4.25)\\) on the other graph tells us the cost of riding a Great Cabs taxi for 2 miles. We can convey the same information much more efficiently by naming each function and using function notation to specify the input and the output. Let\u2019s name the function for Friendly Rides function \\(f\\). Let's name the function for Great Cabs function \\(g\\). To refer to the cost of riding each taxi for 2 miles, we can write\u00a0\\(f(2)\\) and \\(g(2)\\). To say that a 2-mile trip with Friendly Rides will cost \\$5.70, we can write \\(f(2)=5.70\\). To say that a 2-mile trip with Great Cabs will cost \\$4.25, we can write \\(g(2)=4.25\\). In general, function notation has this form: Image description: <p>Function notation. The letter f, open parenthesis, x, closed parenthesis. F is labeled name of function. X is labeled input of function. The whole thing is labeled output of function.</p> It is read \u201c\\(f\\) of \\(x\\)\u201d and can be interpreted to mean that\u00a0\\(f(x)\\) is the output of a function \\(f\\) when \\(x\\) is the input. The function notation is a concise way to refer to a function and describe its input and output, which can be very useful. Throughout this unit and the course, we will use function notation to talk about functions.  "
