Point out that the graph is made up of two (in this case linear) pieces that correspond to the two rules. Ask students if they can think of other situations that could be represented by piecewise functions. Students may bring up examples, such as parking rates, postage or shipping rates, or pricing by age. Explain that one way to write the rules for this type of function is by using the \u201ccases\u201d notation. The rule for each interval of input is treated as a separate case, with the output listed first, followed by the interval of the input. If the function \\(p\\) represents the price of yogurt for a serving of \\(w\\) ounces, then the rules would be: \\(p(w)=\\begin {cases} \\begin {align} &0.50w, &\\quad& 0 Display the notation for all to see, and demonstrate how to read the notation: \"Function \\(p\\) has a value of \\(0.50w\\) if the input \\(w\\) is greater than 0 and is no more than 8.

Function \\(f\\) gives the train fare, in dollars, for a child who is \\(t\\) years old based on these rules: Free for children under 5 \\$5 for children who are at least 5 but younger than 11 \\$7 for children who are at least 11 but younger than 16 The different prices for different ages tell us that function \\(f\\) is a piecewise function. The graph of a piecewise function is often composed of pieces or segments. The pieces could be connected or disconnected. When disconnected, the graph appears to have breaks or steps. Here is a graph that represents\u00a0\\(f\\). A graph, with origin O. The horizontal axis, age, years, scale from 0 to 16 by 1s. The vertical axis, train fare, dollars, scale from 9 to 8 by 1s. A horizontal line segment, with open circle endpoints, begins at 0 comma 0 and ends at 5 comma 0. A horizontal line segment begins with a closed circle at 5 comma 5 and ends with an open circle at 11 comma 5. A line segment begins with a closed circle at 11 comma 7 and ends with an open circle at 16 comma 7. Image description: <p>A graph.\u00a0</p> It is important to consider the value of the function at the points where the rule changes, or where the graph \u201cbreaks.\u201d For instance, when a child is exactly 5 years old, is the ride free, or does it cost \\$5? On the graph, one segment ends at \\((5,0)\\) and another segment starts at \\((5,5)\\), but the function cannot have both 0 and 5 as outputs when the input is 5! Based on the fare rules, the ride is free only if the child is under 5, which means: \\(f(5)=0\\) is false. On the graph, the point \\((5,0)\\) is marked with an open circle to indicate that it is not included in the first segment (which represents ages that qualify for a free ride). \\(f(5)=5\\) is true. The point \\((5,5)\\) has a closed circle to indicate that it is included in the middle segment (which represents ages that qualify for the\u00a0\\$5 fare). The same reasoning applies when deciding how \\(f(11)\\) and \\(f(16)\\) should be shown on the graph. \\(f(11)=7\\) is true because 11-year-olds ride for \\$7. The point \\((11,7)\\) is a closed circle. \\(f(16)=7\\) is false because a 16-year-old no longer qualifies for a child\u2019s fare. The point \\((16,7)\\) is an open circle. The fare rules can be expressed with function notation: \\( f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0, \\quad 0< x<5\\\\ 5, \\quad 5\\leq x < 11 \\\\7, \\quad 11\\leq x < 16 \\end{cases}\\)  "
