    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students use the skills they've been developing to interpret or create graphs of functions that are less well defined and that model real-life situations that are more complex. The lesson includes two main activities about flag raising and two optional activities that use other contexts for additional practice drawing graphs from descriptions or a video.\nInformation about the functions is presented in the form of verbal descriptions, video clips, and images. More ambiguity is involved here than in cases students have previously encountered, so they will need to persevere in sense making and problem solving (MP1). At times, the information given may be inadequate, so students will need to make assumptions and decisions in order to produce graphs that show the desired behaviors or meet certain requirements. Along the way, students engage in important aspects of mathematical modeling (MP4).",

        "Activity Title": "Flag Raising (Part 1)",
        "Activity Narrative": "Prior to this point, students have had multiple opportunities to interpret graphs of functions in terms of a situation. In most cases, students were given some information about the units of measurement of at least one quantity, which helped them reason about the functions being represented.\nIn this activity, students encounter graphs without units on either of the axes. They interpret the graphs in the context of raising a flag and make a case for whether the graphs are realistic (which may depend on the units chosen for the axes). Students also see for the first time a graph that is a vertical line and think about why this graph does not represent a function.\nAs students relate features of graphs to behaviors of quantities in a situation, they reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2). In explaining and discussing why a graph is or is not realistic, students practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others (MP3).\nIn the digital version of the activity, students use an applet to adjust the scale of a graph in the Are You Ready for More? task. The applet allows students to graph a function and easily test different scales for the viewing window to find one that accurately shows the function. Use the digital version if students need help identifying scales for axes in a digital tool and have time to work on the Are You Ready for More? items.",

Then, give students a moment of quiet time to think about the following questions:\n\u201cWhat might be reasonable units to use for the axes of the graphs?\u201d\n\u201cHow do we know that each graph represents a function?\u201d\nGive students a moment to share their thinking with their partner. Follow with a brief whole-class discussion.\nStudents are likely to suggest seconds as a reasonable unit to use for time and meters or yards as a reasonable unit for height. If these units are not mentioned, ask students about them.\nAssign each group 1, 2, or 3 graphs to describe for the first question. Next, tell partners to take turns interpreting the graphs. Ask students to pause for a whole-class discussion about their interpretations of each graph before moving to the second question.",

Also discuss whether using certain units of measurements would make an unrealistic graph more realistic, or vice versa. (For example, none of the graphs would be realistic if the time is measured in days or months and the height in kilometers or centimeters.)\nNext, solicit some explanations\u00a0for why the vertical line does not represent a function. If not mentioned in students' explanations, bring up a key point: A vertical line can be interpreted to mean that for one particular input (3 units of time, in this case), there is an infinite number of possible outputs.\u00a0Therefore, it cannot represent a function."

In this activity,\u00a0students watch a video of a flag being raised. They sketch a possible graph to represent the height of the flag as a function of time\u00a0and then use their graphs to estimate the rate of change of the flag.\nStudents\u2019 graphs do\u00a0not need to be very precise\u00a0but\u00a0should capture key features of the situation. To do so, students need to make some estimates. For example, they need to gauge the starting height of the flag, the height of the pole, the heights at which pauses happened, and whether the flag was moving at a constant rate between the pauses.\u00a0Students also need to make some decisions about the graph\u2014for instance, the scale to use on each axis and whether the graph should be discrete or continuous. Along the way, students engage in aspects of modeling (MP4).\nIf desired and if possible, provide each student or each group with access to the video so students can replay the clip a few\u00a0times, as needed. As students work, identify those who make different decisions for their graph and can explain their rationale. Ask them to share their work later.\nIf time is limited, focus work time and discussion on\u00a0the graphing portion (the first question).",

Students sketch graphs that could represent the heights of water in two pools, each as a function of time since the pools start to be filled.\nThe modeling demand in this activity is higher than in previous activities, as students are given less quantitative information and, therefore, need to make more assumptions and decisions (MP4). For example, they need to consider whether and how the shape and size of each pool affect the rate at which the water rises, how much longer it would take to fill the large pool compared to the small pool, and how moving a hose from one pool to the other changes the graph of each function.\nStudents are not expected to draw precise graphs. What is more important is that the graphs of the two functions are comparatively correct and reasonable in terms of the situation, that students consider the quantities carefully, and that they can explain their decisions.\nAs students work, look for different assumptions and decisions students make that result in a variety of graphs. Consider asking them to share their graphs and reasoning during the whole-class discussion.",

Her return trip along the same trail took 105 minutes.\nWe can sketch a graph of the distance the hiker has traveled as a function of time based on this description.\nA graph. The horizontal axis, time in minutes, scale from 0 to 210 by 15s. The vertical axis, total distance hiked, scale is 8 units. The curve passes through the points 0 comma 0, 6 comma 16, 24 comma 16, 30 comma 20, 40 comma 20, 60 comma 55, 75 comma 55, 105 comma 35, 110 comma 35, 145 comma 15, 150 comma 15, 180 comma 0.\nImage description: <p>A graph.\u00a0</p>\nEven though we don\u2019t know the specific distances she has traveled or the length of the trail, we can show some important features of the situation in the graph. For example:\nThe intervals in which the distance increased or stayed constant\nHow quickly the distance was increasing\nThe amount of time the hiker was hiking\nIf we are looking at distance from the trailhead (the start of the trail) as a function of time, the graph of the function might look something like this:\nA graph. The horizontal axis, time in minutes, scale from 0 to 210 by 15s. The vertical axis, distance from trailhead, scale is 8 units. The curve passes through the points 0 comma 0, 6 comma 16, 24 comma 16, 30 comma 20, 40 comma 20, 60 comma 55, 75 comma 55, 105 comma 35, 110 comma 35, 145 comma 15, 150 comma 15, 180 comma 0.\nImage description: <p>A graph.\u00a0</p>\nIt shows the distance increasing as the hiker was walking away from the trailhead, then decreasing as she was returning to the trailhead."
