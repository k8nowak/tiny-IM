To write an equation for a possible linear model, students may find a line of best fit (and then determine its slope and vertical intercept, by hand or using technology), or they may find an average rate of change between two meaningful points on the data. Students engage in aspects of modeling (MP4) as they make such decisions. Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",

If so, highlight this connection and discuss how the inverse function could help answer the questions about time. ## Lesson Synthesis Discuss with students: \"In this lesson, we saw some real-world situations where it was useful to find the inverse of a function. What kinds of problems does the inverse of a function allow us to solve? How do they help us understand a situation?\" ## Student Lesson Summary The water in a rain barrel is being drained and used to water a garden. Function \\(v\\) gives the volume of water remaining in the barrel, in gallons, \\(t\\) minutes after it started being drained. This equation represents the function: \\(v(t) = 60 - 2.25t\\) From the equation and description, we can reason that there were 60 gallons of water in the rain barrel, and that it was being drained at a constant rate of 2.25 gallons per minute. This equation is handy for finding out the amount of water left in the barrel after some number of minutes. In other words, it helps us find the output, \\(v(t)\\), when we know the input, \\(t\\). Suppose we want to know how long it would take before the barrel has 20 gallons of water remaining\u00a0or how long it would take to empty the barrel. Let's find the inverse of function \\(v\\) so that the volume of water is the input and time is the output. Even though the equation is in function notation, we can still solve for \\(t\\) as we had done before: \\(\\begin {align} v(t) &= 60-2.25t\\\\v(t) + 2.25t &= 60\\\\ 2.25t &= 60-v(t)\\\\ t &=\\dfrac{60-v(t)}{2.25} \\end{align}\\) This equation now shows \\(t\\) as the output and \\(v(t)\\) as the input. We can easily find or estimate the time when the barrel will have 20 gallons remaining by substituting 20 for \\(v(t)\\)\u00a0and then evaluating \\(\\frac{60-20}{2.25}\\).\u00a0Or we can find the time when the barrel will have 0 gallons remaining by substituting 0 for \\(v(t)\\) and evaluating \\(\\frac{60\u22120}{2.25}\\).
