            "activity_narrative": "This activity introduces students to average rate of change\u00a0by building on what students know about rate of change and slope. Students see that finding the change in the output for every unit of change in the input can be a useful way to generalize what happens between two function values, regardless of the behaviors of individual data points between them. They recognize that this number tells us how\u2014on average\u2014one quantity is changing relative to the other, and that it can be useful for comparing the trends in different intervals of a function. In the activity, students find average rates of change by reasoning and using their knowledge of linear relationships. Monitor for students who use\u00a0these\u00a0strategies (the examples shown are for finding the average rate of change between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.): Find the hourly changes in temperature, and calculate the average. The temperature fell by \\(2^\\circ \\text{F}\\) the first hour, then \\(4^\\circ \\text{F}\\), \\(0 ^\\circ \\text{F}\\), and \\(3^\\circ \\text{F}\\) in the next three hours. The average is \\(\\frac{2+4+0+3}{4} = \\frac94\\), or \\(2.25 ^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour. Find the overall change in temperature, and divide it by the overall change in hours. The temperature fell \\(9^\\circ F\\) in 4 hours, which means an average drop of \\(2.25^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour. Find the slope of the line connecting the two end points of the interval. The slope between \\((6,17)\\) and \\((10,8)\\) is \\(\\frac{8-17}{10-6}=\\frac{\\text-9}{4}=\\text-2.25\\), which means an average drop of \\(2.25^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour. Plan to have students present in this order to support connecting rate of change to what students already know about slope. In the Activity Synthesis, students generalize their reasoning and see that finding the average rate of change is indeed equivalent to finding the slope of the line connecting the two points.",

If so, how?\u201d ((It fell 17 degrees Fahrenheit in 6 hours.\u00a0If it was falling at a constant rate, it would be falling \\(\\frac{17}{6}\\), or about 2.8, degrees Fahrenheit per hour.

It might not be falling at the same rate.) Display a scatter plot with the hourly data points plotted.

Could we still say that it was falling about \\(2.8^\\circ \\text{F}\\) an hour?\u201d Students are likely to comment that a line connecting \\((4,25)\\) and \\((10,8)\\) approximates the distribution of points in that interval and conclude that \\(\\text-2.8^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour is a reasonable rate to use. Explain to students that it can be helpful to have a way to quantify how a quantity is changing over a particular interval, without having to worry about the smaller changes in between them. The rate of \\(\\text-2.8^\\circ \\text{F}\\) per hour serves that purpose.

We can visually compare the steepness of the lines connecting the endpoints of each graph. ## Lesson Synthesis Discuss questions such as: \u201cHow would you explain average rate of change to a classmate who is absent today? What does it tell us? How do we find it?\u201d \u201cWhich representation\u2014a table or a graph\u2014can give us a better sense of the general trend of a function over a certain interval? Why?\u201d (a graph, because we can visualize a line that fits the data in an interval and reason about its slope) \u201cWhat does a negative average rate of change tell us?\u201d (The output of the function is decreasing for every unit of increase in input.) \u201cIf a function has a negative average rate of change over an interval, does it mean that the function value never increases?\u201d (No, there might be parts of the interval in which the function value rises, but overall, it is falling.) \u201cWhen dealing with Mai and Tyler\u2019s case, we compared average rates of change over two intervals that are not the same length. Was that a fair comparison? Does the length of the interval matter?\u201d (Yes, it is a fair comparison. The length of the interval doesn\u2019t matter because an average rate of change gives the amount of change per unit of input.) ## Student Lesson Summary Here is a graph of one day\u2019s temperature as a function of time.

The\u00a0increase wasn't constant, however. The temperature rose from 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., stayed steady for an hour, then rose again. On average, how fast was the temperature rising between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.?Let's calculate the average rate of change and measure the temperature change per hour. We do that by\u00a0finding the difference in the temperature between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. and dividing it by the number of hours in that interval.\\(\\text{average rate of change}=\\dfrac{45-35}{5}=\\dfrac{10}{5}=2\\)On average, the temperature between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. increased \\(2^\\circ \\text{F}\\)\u00a0per hour.
