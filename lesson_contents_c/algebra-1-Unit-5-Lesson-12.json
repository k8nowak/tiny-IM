    "Lesson Narrative": "This lesson introduces a new type of function, a piecewise-defined function, that uses\u00a0multiple descriptions to define the function on different parts of the domain. All piecewise functions in this lesson are presented in the context of situations where different rules apply for different input values, such as different bike rental prices for different rental durations\u00a0and different postage rates for different letter weights.\nIn the bike rental activity, students are given the rules of a function and asked to graph the function. To do so, they pay attention to the boundary points, where one rule ends and another begins, and learn to use open and closed circles to indicate the correct output values for the input values that demarcate the rules.\nStudents are also introduced to the cases notation for piecewise functions. They practice interpreting it, which involves making use of the structure in the graph and in cases notation (MP7).",

Students may bring up examples, such as parking rates, postage or shipping rates, or pricing by age.\nExplain that one way to write the rules for this type of function is by using the \u201ccases\u201d notation. The rule for each interval of input is treated as a separate case, with the output listed first, followed by the interval of the input.\nIf the function \\(p\\) represents the price of yogurt for a serving of \\(w\\) ounces, then the rules would be:\n\\(p(w)=\\begin {cases} \\begin {align} &0.50w, &\\quad& 0\nDisplay the notation for all to see, and demonstrate how to read the notation: \"Function \\(p\\) has a value of \\(0.50w\\) if the input \\(w\\) is greater than 0 and is no more than 8.

So an open circle corresponds to the\u00a0\\(<\\)\u00a0symbol or the\u00a0\\(>\\)\u00a0symbol. A point with a closed (or solid) circle means the coordinate values of that point are included, so it corresponds to the\u00a0\\(\\le\\)\u00a0symbol or the\u00a0\\(\\geq\\)\u00a0symbol.)\n\"By looking at the graph, how can you tell how many cases should be included in the equation?\" (Each piece of the graph is a case.)\nIf time permits, ask students about the domain and range for this function. Assuming that a mail item heavier than 3.5 ounces no longer qualifies as a letter, the domain would include weights that are greater than 0 but no more than 3.5 ounces (\\(0).
