    "Lesson Narrative": "In this opening lesson, students recall the meaning of functions (which was introduced in grade 8) and encounter examples of functions and their representations in context. They use tables and graphs that represent relationships to determine whether the relationships are functions or not. Students are also reminded of the meaning of points on a graph as an input-output pair for a function and its meaning in the context of a real-life situation.\nStudents define a function as a relationship that takes inputs from one set and assigns them to outputs from another set, assigning exactly one output to each input. They also define an independent variable as the input of a function and a dependent variable as the output of a function.\nStudents practice making sense of problems and persevering in solving them (MP1) as they look for and explain correspondences between verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs. They engage in aspects of modeling (MP4) as they identify input and output variables in real-life situations and create representations of their relationships.",

They see that for some numbers of bagels bought, there are multiple possible prices. The relationship between the number of bagels bought and the best price, however, do form a function, because there is only one possible best price for each number of bagels.\nStudents contrast the two relationships by reasoning about possible prices, completing a table of values, and observing the graphs of the relationships.",

Along the way, students interpret each point on the graph to mean a particular point in time and a particular distance from the post.\nStudents later reason that the relationship between time and distance is a function because the dog can be in only one location at any given time. For instance, the dog could not be both 5 feet and 1.7 feet away from the post at the same exact time.\nAs students work, monitor for students that create a graph with a vertical value greater than 5 or a graph that does not go through the two given points.

Solicit as many\u00a0explanations as possible of why it is. To emphasize that a function is a relationship in which one output is assigned to every input, explain that:\nThe dog can be in only one spot at a time and cannot have more than one distance away from the post at any time.\nOn each graph, we can see that only one value for distance corresponds to each value for time.\nAsk students,\n\u201cIn this situation, what is the input and what is the output?\u201d (It makes sense for time in seconds to be the input and distance from the post to be the output.)\n\u201cIs it possible for the distance to be the input and the time to be the output? Why or why not?\u201d (It is possible, but if the distance is the input, the relationship is no longer a function. This is because there could be multiple possible times at which the dog is a certain distance away from the post.)\nRemind students that a quantity that is an input for a function is called an independent variable, and a quantity that is an output is called a dependent variable.

The context is the same as in the previous activity, but the quantities are different.\nDeciding on which variable is independent and which is dependent, as well as sketching a graph of the relationship, engages students in aspects of modeling (MP4). It requires students to make sense of quantities, consider how they are related, and think about what values are reasonable. Using the language of \u201cfunction\u201d to articulate the relationship between variables is an opportunity to attend to precision (MP6).\nWhen sketching a graph for the function that defines the number of barks, students are likely to create either a discrete graph or a continuous graph. (Because the total number of barks cannot be fractional, creating a step graph would most accurately represent\u00a0it as a function of time, but students are not expected to do so at this point.)

This is because at any amount of time since takeoff, the plane could be at only one height above the ground.For example, 50 seconds after takeoff, the plane might have a height of 180 feet. At that moment, it cannot be simultaneously 180 feet and 95 feet above the ground.For any input, there is only one possible output, so the height of the plane is a function of the time since takeoff.\nThese two quantities form a function if time is the independent variable (the input) and height is the dependent variable (the output).
