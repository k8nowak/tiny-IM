Students may find Elena's rule easier to explain because of their work with absolute value in recent activities. They may struggle to explain Andre's rule. We can reason about Andre's equation a couple of ways: By thinking about rules: The equation is that of a piecewise function because different rules are applied to different parts of the domain to give\u00a0\u201cthe distance from 0\u201d as the output:When the input \\(x\\) is positive or 0, its distance from 0 is that same number, \\(x\\).When the input \\(x\\) is negative, its distance from 0 is the opposite of the number, \\(\\text-x\\).

The graphs have the same V shape but not the same vertex. The expressions that define the functions have a constant term added to or subtracted from the input, \\(x\\), or from the absolute value of the input, \\(|x|\\). Students observe how each constant term affects the graph and consider possible explanations. Dynamic graphing technology can be very useful for observing how the parameters of a function are related to the features of its graph and can help students generalize their observations. Consider giving students individual access to dynamic graphing technology\u00a0and then giving them time to explain the behaviors of the graphs. If students don't have individual access, projecting the applet in the digital Launch would be helpful. Although digital tools can help students notice the connection between the parameters and the graph easily, it is still important for students to understand why they behave in that way. Monitor for students who use these different strategies: Find some input-output pairs for each function and verify that the graph contains those pairs of values. Interpret the expressions in terms of finding an absolute error of a guess. Use the position of the number added or subtracted to reason about how the inputs and outputs are affected in the graph. Plan to have students present in this order to support moving students from plotting points to thinking of functions as an object that can be translated. In the digital version of the activity, students use an applet to adjust the parameters for translating functions. The applet allows students to see how the different values affect the graph in real time. Use the digital version if available so that students can more easily see the connections between the values added to different parts of the function and the\u00a0result for the graph.",

In making the matches (and before using technology to check their graphs), students are likely to reason in different ways and rely on structure to varying degrees (MP7). For instance, students may: Evaluate each function at different input values and then match the input-output pairs to the coordinates on the graphs.

Because absolute guessing error tells us how far a guess is from a target number, the output is distance. Suppose the target number is 0. We can find the distance of a guess, \\(x\\), from 0 by calculating \\(x-0\\). Because distance cannot be negative, what we want to find is \\(|x-0|\\), or simply \\(|x|\\). If function \\(f\\) gives the distance of \\(x\\) from 0, we can define it with this equation: \\(f(x)=|x|\\) Function \\(f\\) is the\u00a0absolute value function. It gives the distance of \\(x\\) from 0 by finding the absolute value of \\(x\\). The graph of function \\(f\\) is a V shape with the two lines converging at \\((0,0)\\). We call this point the vertex of the graph. It is the point where a graph changes direction, from going down to going up, or the other way around. We can also think of a function like \\(f\\) as a piecewise function because different rules apply when \\(x\\) is less than 0 and when \\(x\\) is greater than 0. Image description: <p>Graph of absolute value function with vertex at origin.</p> Suppose we want to find the distance between \\(x\\) and 4. We can find the difference between \\(x\\) and 4 by calculating \\(x-4\\). Distance cannot be negative, so what we want is the absolute value of that difference: \\(|x-4|\\). If function \\(p\\) gives the distance of \\(x\\) from 4, we can define it with this equation: \\(p(x)= |x - 4|\\) Image description: <p>Graph of absolute value function p with vertex at 4 comma 0.</p> Now suppose we want to find the distance between \\(x\\) and -4. We can find the difference of \\(x\\) and -4 by calculating \\(x-(\\text-4)\\), which is equal to \\(x+4\\). Distance cannot be negative, so let's find the absolute value: \\(|x+4|\\). If function \\(q\\) gives the distance of \\(x\\) from -4, we can define it with this equation: \\(q(x)= |x + 4|\\) Image description: <p>Graph of absolute value function q with vertex at -4\u00a0comma 0.</p> Notice that the graphs of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are like that of \\(f\\), but they have shifted horizontally.
