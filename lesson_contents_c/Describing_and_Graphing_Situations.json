Students first encounter a relationship in which two quantities\u2014the number of bagels bought and price\u2014do not form a function. They see that for some numbers of bagels bought, there are multiple possible prices. The relationship between the number of bagels bought and the best price, however, do form a function, because there is only one possible best price for each number of bagels. Students contrast the two relationships by reasoning about possible prices, completing a table of values, and observing the graphs of the relationships.",

Invite students to share an explanation of how each person in the situation could be right. If possible, record and display students\u2019 reasoning for all to see.

Students are given descriptions of the dog\u2019s movement while it was attached to a post\u00a0and asked to sketch corresponding graphs. Along the way, students interpret each point on the graph to mean a particular point in time and a particular distance from the post. Students later reason that the relationship between time and distance is a function because the dog can be in only one location at any given time. For instance, the dog could not be both 5 feet and 1.7 feet away from the post at the same exact time. As students work, monitor for students that create a graph with a vertical value greater than 5 or a graph that does not go through the two given points. If many graphs show these features, discuss with the class why the former is not possible and why the latter does not match the given descriptions.",

Day 3: The dog tried to follow its owner into the store but was stopped by the leash. Then, it started walking around the post in one direction. It kept walking until its leash was completely wound up around the post. The dog stayed there until its owner returned. Each day, the dog was 1.5 feet away from the post when the owner left. Each day, 60 seconds after the owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post. Your teacher will assign one of the days for you to analyze.

One takeaway from this activity is that the relationship between the time since the owner left and the dog\u2019s distance from the post is a function. Solicit as many\u00a0explanations as possible of why it is. To emphasize that a function is a relationship in which one output is assigned to every input, explain that: The dog can be in only one spot at a time and cannot have more than one distance away from the post at any time. On each graph, we can see that only one value for distance corresponds to each value for time. Ask students, \u201cIn this situation, what is the input and what is the output?\u201d (It makes sense for time in seconds to be the input and distance from the post to be the output.) \u201cIs it possible for the distance to be the input and the time to be the output? Why or why not?\u201d (It is possible, but if the distance is the input, the relationship is no longer a function. This is because there could be multiple possible times at which the dog is a certain distance away from the post.) Remind students that a quantity that is an input for a function is called an independent variable, and a quantity that is an output is called a dependent variable. In this case, time is independent and distance from the post is dependent."

The context is the same as in the previous activity, but the quantities are different. Deciding on which variable is independent and which is dependent, as well as sketching a graph of the relationship, engages students in aspects of modeling (MP4). It requires students to make sense of quantities, consider how they are related, and think about what values are reasonable. Using the language of \u201cfunction\u201d to articulate the relationship between variables is an opportunity to attend to precision (MP6). When sketching a graph for the function that defines the number of barks, students are likely to create either a discrete graph or a continuous graph. (Because the total number of barks cannot be fractional, creating a step graph would most accurately represent\u00a0it as a function of time, but students are not expected to do so at this point.)

Ask the students\u00a0to briefly explain how they decided which quantity should be the input and which should be the output and what the graph should look like. If it is not brought up, remind students of the definition of a function and that the number of barks must be a function of time because there are many times when the total number of barks is the same (for example, in the sample response, the dog barked a total of 2 times at 10 seconds and 20 seconds). If the dog barked consistently every second and we chose to measure time only in whole numbers of seconds, it might be possible to tell time by the number of barks and it might be reasonable for the number of seconds that have passed to be a function of the number of barks. ## Lesson Synthesis Refer back to the situations in the last two activities. Discuss with students why\u00a0for each relationship to be a function, it makes sense for time to be the independent variable and the other quantity to be the dependent variable. Ask students, \u201cIn the situation that involved time and number of barks, suppose the number of barks is the input and the time is the output. Is it possible that when the number of barks is 6, both 15 seconds and 16 seconds have passed?\u201d (Yes.) \u201cCan the time be a function of the number of barks? Why or why not?\u201d (No. For any number of barks, more than one possible time\u00a0could be the output.) \u201cIn the situation that involved time and the total distance walked by the dog, suppose the distance is the input and the time is the output. Is it possible that when the dog has walked 27 feet, 50 seconds, 55 seconds, and 60 seconds have passed?\u201d (Yes.) \u201cCan the time be a function of the total distance walked? Why or why not?\u201d (No. For any number of feet walked, many possible numbers of seconds could have passed.) If time permits, ask students to think of another example of a possible function in that situation (the number of times the dog was petted by a passerby as a function of time, for example)\u00a0and to identify the input and output variables. ## Student Lesson Summary A relationship between two quantities is a function if there is exactly one output for each input. We call the input the independent variable and the output the dependent variable. Let\u2019s look at the relationship between the amount of time since a plane takes off, in seconds, and the plane\u2019s height above the ground, in feet. These two quantities form a function if time is the independent variable (the input) and height is the dependent variable (the output). This is because at any amount of time since takeoff, the plane could be at only one height above the ground.For example, 50 seconds after takeoff, the plane might have a height of 180 feet. At that moment, it cannot be simultaneously 180 feet and 95 feet above the ground.For any input, there is only one possible output, so the height of the plane is a function of the time since takeoff. These two quantities form a function if time is the independent variable (the input) and height is the dependent variable (the output). This is because at any amount of time since takeoff, the plane could be at only one height above the ground. For example, 50 seconds after takeoff, the plane might have a height of 180 feet. At that moment, it cannot be simultaneously 180 feet and 95 feet above the ground. For any input, there is only one possible output, so the height of the plane is a function of the time since takeoff. The two quantities do not form a function, however, if we consider height as the input and time as the output. This is because the plane can be at the same height for multiple lengths of times since takeoff.For instance, the plane will likely be 100 feet above the ground shortly after takeoff as well as shortly before landing.For an\u00a0input, there are multiple possible outputs, so the time since takeoff is not a function of the height of the plane. The two quantities do not form a function, however, if we consider height as the input and time as the output. This is because the plane can be at the same height for multiple lengths of times since takeoff. For instance, the plane will likely be 100 feet above the ground shortly after takeoff as well as shortly before landing. For an\u00a0input, there are multiple possible outputs, so the time since takeoff is not a function of the height of the plane. Functions can be represented in many ways\u2014with a verbal description, a table of values, a graph, an expression or an equation, or a set of ordered pairs. When a function is represented with a graph, each point on the graph is a specific pair of an input and output. Here is a graph that shows the height of a plane as a function of time since takeoff. Graph of a function, origin O. Horizontal axis from 0 to 300, by 50s, time in seconds. Vertical axis from 0 to 1500, by 250s, height in feet. Function begins at zero and goes through 50 comma 180, 250 comma 1500, and 250 comma 1500. Point 125 comma 400 is noted. Image description: <p>Graph of a function, origin O.</p> It is a function because there is one output for each input. The point \\((125, 400)\\) on the function's graph tells us that 125 seconds after takeoff, the height of the plane is 400 feet. Here is a graph that shows the time since takeoff as the output and the height of the plane as the input. Image description: A graph with height in feet on the x-axis and time in hours on the y-axis. This is not a function because an input of 100 feet has two possible outputs.  "
