They use rules to evaluate functions and interpret the input and output values in context. For instance, students see that \\(B(1)\\) represents the cost of using the service 1 month beyond the trial period, and find its value by computing \\(10(1)+250\\). Students also use rules of functions to solve for an unknown input value. For example, given the rule \\(B(x) = 10x + 250\\) and the statement \\(B(x)=280\\), they work to find a value of \\(x\\) that makes \\(B(x) = 280\\) true. Monitor for students who use these strategies: Guessing and checking Analyzing the graph of \\(y=10x+250\\) and identifying the \\(x\\)-value when \\(y\\) is 280 Reasoning that a budget of \\$280\u00a0means that only \\$30 is available for additional months, and at \\$10 per month, it means 3 additional months of service.

Invite students to share their interpretations, in particular the meaning of \u201ctrial period.\u201d Many subscription services provide a trial period in which the service is free before users are charged for their time afterward. Before students begin the activity, make sure they see that an input value of 1 represents 1 month of the service\u00a0after\u00a0the trial period. Also tell students that the providers will charge a \u201cprorated\u201d amount for canceling in the middle of the month. For example, if the service is canceled on the 15th of the month, the user will be charged for half of the usual month\u2019s fees.

            "student_task_statement": "Elena is looking at options for video game consoles. Each option begins with a purchase of the console and a 1 month free trial period of the online gaming service. The monthly cost of each option can be seen as a function and represented with an equation: Option A: \\(A(x) = 600\\) Option B: \\(B(x) = 10x + 250\\) In each function, the input, \\(x\\), represents the number of months Elena uses the online gaming service after the free trial period. Elena decides to find the values of \\(A(1)\\) and \\(B(1)\\) and compare them. What are those values? When planning her budget, she compares\u00a0\\(A(7.5)\\) and \\(B(7.5)\\).

            "activity_synthesis": "The purpose of this discussion is to explore linear functions that represent situations and examine how to solve functions when the input or output value is known. Select students to share their interpretations of the two options. Make sure students see that: The equation \\(A(x)=600\\) tells us that, regardless of the number of months the service is used, \\(x\\), the cost, \\(A(x)\\) is always 600. The \\(10x\\) in the rule of \\(B(x)\\) tells us that each extra month of service after the trial period\u00a0costs \\$10, and that there is a \\$250 price for the console. Explain to students that the two functions here are linear functions because the output of each function changes at a constant rate relative to the input. Option B involves a rate of change of \\$10 per additional month after the trial period, while Option A has a rate of change of \\$0 per additional month after the trial period. Then, ask students how they went about graphing the functions. Students are likely to have plotted some input-output pairs of each function. If no students mention\u00a0identifying the slope and vertical intercept of each graph, ask them about it. Invite previously selected groups to share how they solved the last question. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see. Connect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions, such as: \u201cHow did the console price show up in your work of\u00a0finding the number of months Elena could get for \\$280?\u201d (It is the constant 250 in the function. I subtracted that from the budgeted \\$280 to see that there is \\$30 left for additional months.) \u201cHow would these methods change if Elena had budgeted \\$300?\u201d (I would replace the 280 with 300 in my equation and solve the new equation for \\(x\\).) \u201cWhy is the graph of \\(A(x)\\) a horizontal line?\u201d (\\(A(x)\\) is the output of function \\(A\\) and is represented by vertical values on a coordinate plane. The vertical values are typically labeled with the variable \\(y\\), so we can write \\(y = A(x)\\) and graph \\(y = 600\\) to represent function \\(A\\).) \u201cHow can we see the slope and intercept of the graph of Option B in the function?\u201d (\\(B(x)\\) \u00a0is the output of function \\(B\\) and is represented by vertical values on a plane. We can write \\(y = B(x)\\) or \\(y = 10x+250\\) to see that the slope is 10 and the \\(y\\)-intercept is 250.)
