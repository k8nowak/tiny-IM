    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students use rules of functions to find the output when the input is given (or to evaluate functions) and to find the input when the output is known (or to solve equations that define functions). They also interpret rules of functions in terms of a situation. Along the way, they practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).\nThe term linear function is introduced here. In middle school, students learned that a relationship between two quantities is linear if one quantity changes at a constant rate relative to the other. Students see that a linear function can be understood in similar terms: A function is linear if the output changes by a constant rate relative to its input.\nThis lesson includes an optional activity that is designed to enable students to use technology to graph and evaluate functions expressed in function notation. This skill can help to develop students\u2019 understanding of functions and ability to solve problems in this unit and in future units.",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students work with rules of functions that arise from situations and continue to make connections between different representations of functions. They use rules to evaluate functions and interpret the input and output values in context. For instance, students see that \\(B(1)\\) represents the cost of using the service 1 month beyond the trial period, and find its value by computing \\(10(1)+250\\).\nStudents also use rules of functions to solve for an unknown input value. For example, given the rule \\(B(x) = 10x + 250\\) and the statement \\(B(x)=280\\), they work to find a value of \\(x\\) that makes \\(B(x) = 280\\) true. Monitor for students who use these strategies:\nGuessing and checking\nAnalyzing the graph of \\(y=10x+250\\) and identifying the \\(x\\)-value when \\(y\\) is 280\nReasoning that a budget of \\$280\u00a0means that only \\$30 is available for additional months, and at \\$10 per month, it means 3 additional months of service.\nSolving \\(10x+250=280\\) algebraically\nPlan to have students present in this order to support moving students toward more precise algebraic thinking.",
        "Launch": "Arrange students in groups of 2.\nAs a class, read the opening paragraphs and the first question in the activity statement. Ask students,\u00a0\u201cWhat do \\(A(1)\\) and \\(B(1)\\) represent in this situation? What does the 1 in each expression mean?\u201d Give students a minute of quiet think time and then time to discuss their thinking with their partner.\nInvite students to share their interpretations, in particular the meaning of \u201ctrial period.\u201d Many subscription services provide a trial period in which the service is free before users are charged for their time afterward. Before students begin the activity, make sure they see that an input value of 1 represents 1 month of the service\u00a0after\u00a0the trial period.\nAlso tell students that the providers will charge a \u201cprorated\u201d amount for canceling in the middle of the month. For example, if the service is canceled on the 15th of the month, the user will be charged for half of the usual month\u2019s fees.\nSelect groups with different strategies, such as those described in the Activity Narrative, to share later.",
        "Student Task Statement": "Elena is looking at options for video game consoles. Each option begins with a purchase of the console and a 1 month free trial period of the online gaming service. The monthly cost of each option can be seen as a function and represented with an equation:\nOption A: \\(A(x) = 600\\)\nOption B: \\(B(x) = 10x + 250\\)\nIn each function, the input, \\(x\\), represents the number of months Elena uses the online gaming service after the free trial period.\nElena decides to find the values of \\(A(1)\\) and \\(B(1)\\) and compare them. What are those values?\nWhen planning her budget, she compares\u00a0\\(A(7.5)\\) and \\(B(7.5)\\). What are those values?\nDescribe each option in words.\nGraph each function on the same coordinate plane.

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Students may question if\u00a0\\(A\\) is a function at all\u00a0because unlike \\(B\\) or other function rules they have seen so far,\u00a0\\(A(x)\\)\u00a0is defined with a constant instead of an expression containing the dependent\u00a0variable. Or they may wonder why\u00a0\\(A(x)\\) has the same value no matter what the input value\u00a0is. Ask students to recall the definition of function and to consider whether each input value gives only one output value. Because it does, even though it is always the same output value, \\(A\\) is still a function.",
        "Are You Ready for More?": "Describe an option that, for any amount of time used, would cost no more than one of the given options and no less than the other given option. Explain or show how you know this option would meet these requirements.",
        "Activity Synthesis": "The purpose of this discussion is to explore linear functions that represent situations and examine how to solve functions when the input or output value is known.\nSelect students to share their interpretations of the two options. Make sure students see that:\nThe equation \\(A(x)=600\\) tells us that, regardless of the number of months the service is used, \\(x\\), the cost, \\(A(x)\\) is always 600.\nThe \\(10x\\) in the rule of \\(B(x)\\) tells us that each extra month of service after the trial period\u00a0costs \\$10, and that there is a \\$250 price for the console.\nExplain to students that the two functions here are linear functions because the output of each function changes at a constant rate relative to the input. Option B involves a rate of change of \\$10 per additional month after the trial period, while Option A has a rate of change of \\$0 per additional month after the trial period.\nThen, ask students how they went about graphing the functions. Students are likely to have plotted some input-output pairs of each function. If no students mention\u00a0identifying the slope and vertical intercept of each graph, ask them about it.\nInvite previously selected groups to share how they solved the last question. Sequence the discussion of the strategies by the order listed in the Activity Narrative. If possible, record and display their work for all to see.\nConnect the different responses to the learning goals by asking questions, such as:\n\u201cHow did the console price show up in your work of\u00a0finding the number of months Elena could get for \\$280?\u201d (It is the constant 250 in the function. I subtracted that from the budgeted \\$280 to see that there is \\$30 left for additional months.)\n\u201cHow would these methods change if Elena had budgeted \\$300?\u201d (I would replace the 280 with 300 in my equation and solve the new equation for \\(x\\).)\n\u201cWhy is the graph of \\(A(x)\\) a horizontal line?\u201d (\\(A(x)\\) is the output of function \\(A\\) and is represented by vertical values on a coordinate plane. The vertical values are typically labeled with the variable \\(y\\), so we can write \\(y = A(x)\\) and graph \\(y = 600\\) to represent function \\(A\\).)\n\u201cHow can we see the slope and intercept of the graph of Option B in the function?\u201d (\\(B(x)\\) \u00a0is the output of function \\(B\\) and is represented by vertical values on a plane. We can write \\(y = B(x)\\) or \\(y = 10x+250\\) to see that the slope is 10 and the \\(y\\)-intercept is 250.)\nIf time permits, invite students to share which option they believe Elena should choose and why."
