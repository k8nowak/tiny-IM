        "Activity Narrative": "Earlier in the course, students have spent some time writing equations in one variable, two variables, and multiple variables to represent relationships and constraints. They have also rearranged equations to isolate a particular variable. This Warm-up activates that prior knowledge, preparing students to write equations for linear functions that involve two or more operations, and then to write their inverses.\nTo ensure access, the equations students are expected to write are scaffolded\u2014starting with one operation and moving to two operations, from using numbers and letters to using only letters. The scaffolding also allows students to see structure in the equations, which would be helpful when they try to reverse the process.",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students investigate inverse functions in the context of temperature scales.\nStudents are given an equation that defines the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit as a function of the temperature in degrees Celsius (\\(F = \\frac59 C+32\\)) and are asked to find some temperatures in both units. Using this equation to find a temperature in degrees Celsius involves substituting the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for \\(F\\) and solving the equation. Students do so several times over. The regularity in repeated reasoning with numerical values (MP8) paves the way for students to write the equation for the inverse function, which entails solving for \\(C\\) before substituting values of \\(F\\).\nStudents are also prompted to verify that two unfamiliar equations represent inverse functions. To do so, students need to analyze the structure of one equation, use it to reverse the process that defines the function, and see if the reversal leads to the other equation (MP7).",

Write an equation to represent the inverse function. Be prepared to explain your reasoning.\nThe equation \\(R = \u200b\\frac{9}{5}\u200b (C + 273.15)\\) defines the temperature in degrees Rankine as a function of the temperature in degrees Celsius.\u00a0Show that the equation \\(C=(R\u2212491.67)\\boldcdot\\frac{5}{9}\\) defines the inverse of that function.\nThe equation \\(R = \u200b\\frac{9}{5}\u200b (C + 273.15)\\) defines the temperature in degrees Rankine as a function of the temperature in degrees Celsius.\nShow that the equation \\(C=(R\u2212491.67)\\boldcdot\\frac{5}{9}\\) defines the inverse of that function.",
        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students may struggle to solve for \\(C\\) because of the rational coefficient of \\(C\\) in \\(F=\\frac95 C + 32\\). They may be able to rearrange the equation to \\(F-32=\\frac95 C\\) but then get stuck at that point. Some strategies for supporting their reasoning:\nThink of \\(\\frac95\\) simply as a number being multiplied to \\(C\\), so to find \\(C\\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \\(\\frac 95\\). (Students can still reason this way even if they do not recall or know that dividing by \\(\\frac95\\) gives the same result as multiplying by \\(\\frac59\\). Their resulting equation may look like: \\((F-32) \\div \\frac95 = C\\).)\nThink of \\(\\frac95 C\\) as \\(9 \\boldcdot \\frac15 \\boldcdot C\\), and then undo one operation at a time.\nWrite \\(\\frac95\\) as a decimal, 1.8, and divide both sides of the equation by 1.8. (Clarify that, depending on the fraction, rewriting a fraction as a decimal may not always be the most helpful way to go.)\nIn the course of solving for a variable, students may neglect to apply the distributive property correctly when multiplying a number to an expression. For example, when performing the last step to solve \\(F-32=\\frac95 C\\) for \\(C\\), they may write \\(\\frac59F - 32=C\\), instead of \\(\\frac59 (F-32)\\). Remind students that any operation performed on both sides of an equation needs to be applied to all the parts on each side.",

Which equation would you use? Why?\" (the second equation, because it doesn't involve solving an equation, which tends to be quicker)\n\"How did you verify that the two equations that relate the temperature in degrees Rankine and the temperature in degrees Celsius are inverse functions?\" (by solving the first equation for \\(C\\) and seeing if it matches the second equation, or by solving the second equation for \\(R\\) and seeing if it matches the first equation)\n\"What does each inverse function tell us?\" (The first one tells us how to find the temperature in degrees Celsius if we know the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. The second tells us how to find the temperature in degrees Celsius if we know the temperature in degrees Rankine.)\nIf time permits, display the graphs of the two functions relating temperature in degrees Celsius and in degrees Fahrenheit.

Make sure students see that because the number of seats, \\(S\\), is found by multiplying the number of table, \\(n\\), by 4 and then adding 2, the inverse function can be found by subtracting 2 from \\(S\\) and then dividing the result by 4.\nDiscuss with students:\n\"Why are 23 tables needed for 94 guests but 24 tables needed for just 1 more guest?\" (Entering 95 for \\(S\\) in the equation \\(n=\\frac{S-2}{4}\\)\u00a0gives \\(n=23\\frac14\\), but a fractional value of \\(n\\) does not make sense in this situation, so one more table is needed, though there will be open seats.)\n\"The range of the first function, the set of \\(S\\)-values, is numbers that are 2 more than multiples of 4 (6, 10, 14, . . .). In the inverse function, is the domain limited to the same set of \\(S\\)-values? Or are numbers like 17 and 85 also possible inputs?\"\nHighlight that\u00a0just as solutions to equations need to be interpreted in context, so do the domain and range of a function and its inverse.\nThe equation for the first function, \\(S=4n+2\\), tells us the number of seats at \\(n\\) tables, assuming all the tables are filled completely and regardless of whether the seats are occupied by guests. The range values of 6, 10, 14, . . . reflect these assumptions.\nThe equation for the inverse function, \\(n=\\frac{S-2}{4}\\), gives the number of tables if we know the number of seats, \\(S\\), but we don't assume that the seats completely fill each table. The domain of the inverse function (the set of \\(S\\)-values) could include any whole number (not just 6, 10, 14, . . . ). When an input gives a fractional number of table for the output (such as \\(n=23\\frac14\\)), we need to interpret it in terms of the situation."

    "Student Lesson Summary": "It is helpful to interpret the inverse of a function in terms of a situation and the quantities it represents.\nSuppose a linear function gives the dollar cost, \\(C\\), of renting some equipment for \\(n\\) hours. The function is defined by this equation:\n\\(C = 8.25n+30\\)\nIf we know the number of hours of rental, \\(n\\), we can substitute it into the expression \\(8.25n+30\\) and evaluate it to find the cost, \\(C\\).\nWhat is the inverse of this function, and what does it tell us about the length and cost of rental?\nTo find the inverse, let's solve for \\(n\\):\n\\(\\begin {align} 8.25n + 30 &= C\\\\ 8.25n &=C-30\\\\ n&=\\dfrac {C-30}{8.25} \\end{align}\\)\nIf we know the cost of rental, \\(C\\), we can substitute it into the expression \\(\\dfrac {C-30}{8.25}\\) and evaluate it to find the hours of rental, \\(n\\).\nNotice that the equation defining the inverse function is found by reversing the process that defines the original linear function.\nThe original rule, \\(C=8.25n + 30\\), tells us to multiply the input, \\(n\\), by 8.25 and add 30 to the result to get the output, \\(C\\).\nThe rule of the inverse function, \\(\\dfrac {C-30}{8.25}\\), suggests that we subtract 30 from the input and then divide the result by 8.25 to get the output \\(n\\)."
