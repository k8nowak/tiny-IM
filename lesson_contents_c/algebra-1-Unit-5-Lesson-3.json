    "Lesson Narrative": "In this lesson, students continue to develop their ability to interpret statements in function notation in terms of a situation, including reasoning about inequalities, such as \\(f(a) > f(b)\\). They now have to pay closer attention to the units in which the quantities are measured to effectively interpret symbolic statements. Along the way, students practice reasoning quantitatively and abstractly (MP2) and attending to precision (MP6).\nStudents also begin to connect statements in function notation to graphs of functions. They see each input-output pair of a function \\(f\\) as a point with coordinates \\((x, f(x))\\) when \\(x\\) is the input, and they use information in function notation to sketch a possible graph of a function.\nStudents\u2019 work with graphs is expected to be informal here. In a later lesson, students will focus on identifying features of graphs more formally.",

        "Activity Narrative": "In this Warm-up, students are prompted to compare function values. To do so, they need to interpret statements in function notation and connect their interpretations to the graph of the function.\nPreviously, students recognized that if a point with coordinates \\((2,20)\\) is on the graph of a function, the 2 is an input and the 20 is a corresponding output. Here, they begin to see the second value in a coordinate pair more abstractly, as \\(f(2)\\) when the input is 2 or as \\(f(4)\\) when the input is 4.",

        "Activity Synthesis": "Invite students to share how they compared each pair of outputs. If not mentioned in students\u2019 explanations, point out that for each pair, what we are comparing are the vertical values of the points on the graph at different horizontal values. Even though the statements don\u2019t tell us the values of, say,\u00a0\\(f(3)\\) and \\(f(7)\\), and the vertical axis shows no scale, we can tell from the graph that the function has a greater value when \\(t\\) is 3 than when \\(t\\) is 7.\nTell students that the coordinates \\((0, f(0))\\) represent the starting point of the drone. Ask students,\u00a0\u201cWhat are the coordinates of the points when the drone starts leveling off? When it starts to descend? When it lands?\u201d (\\((2, f(2)), (5,f(5))\\), and \\((7,f(7))\\), respectively)\nHighlight that the coordinates of each point on a graph of a function are\u00a0\\((x, f(x))\\).\nDiscuss with students how they compared \\(f(t)\\) and \\(f(t+1)\\) (in the last question). Make sure students see that the \\(f(t+1)\\) could be less than, equal to, or greater than \\(f(t)\\), depending on the value of \\(t\\).\nIf \\(t\\) is 2, then \\(t+1\\) is 3. From the graph, we can see that \\(f(2)\\) is equal to \\(f(3)\\) because the graph has the same vertical value when \\(t\\) is 2 and 3.\nIf \\(t\\) is 5, then \\(t+1\\) is 6. From the graph, we can see that \\(f(5)\\) is greater than \\(f(6)\\) because the graph has a greater vertical value when\u00a0\\(t\\) is 5 than when \\(t\\) is 6."

        "Activity Narrative": "In this activity, students continue to interpret statements in function notation in terms of a situation. Several things are new here, all of which provide\u00a0opportunities to attend to precision (MP6) and to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).\nThe output of the function is measured in millions, so students need to attend carefully to the units or otherwise may misinterpret the situation (for example, saying that about 2 thousand people rather than about 2 billion people owned smartphones in 2017).\nThe input of the function is measured in \u201cyears after 2000,\u201d so a positive input value \\(t\\) needs to be interpreted as year \\(2000+t\\). For example, the year 2010 should be associated with \\(t=10\\).\nOne of the input values is negative, so students will need to reason about what this means in this situation.\nStudents also consolidate various pieces of information about the function, given in descriptions and function notation, in order to sketch the graph of a function. It is possible for students to sketch many different graphs through the given points, but the context suggests that, over time, the function values are increasing roughly exponentially (though students do not need to know that\u00a0term at this point).",
        "Launch": "Read the\u00a0opening sentence in the Task Statement\u00a0as a class. Ask students to identify the input and output of this function, and the units in which each variable is measured.\nArrange students in groups of 2. Give students 1\u20132 minutes of quiet time to read and make sense of\u00a0the first two questions\u00a0(without writing responses). Urge them to think about what the input and output values are in each statement (given in function notation or in words).\nGive students another\u00a0few minutes to share their thinking with their partner, then, when reaching an agreement,\u00a0to write their responses.\u00a0Insist that\u00a0they write their interpretations for statements in function notation, such as \\(P(17)=2,\\!320\\), in\u00a0complete sentences and use the quantity names and units. Ask students to pause for a class discussion before they continue with the rest of the activity.\nInvite students to share their responses to the first two questions. Before students complete the remaining questions, make\u00a0sure they see why:\nThe number of smartphone owners in the first question is not\u00a0a couple of thousand people. The output is measured in millions, so a number such as\u00a02,320\u00a0means 2,320 million, or 2.32 billion, people.\nThe input value for year 2010 is not 2010. The input is measured in \u201cyears after year 2000,\u201d so the input for year 2010 is 10. An input of 2010 would mean year 4010!",

        "Building on Student Thinking": "Some students may struggle to express a number like 296,600,000 in millions, or they may think that a quantity like 2,320 million doesn\u2019t quite make sense. Ask them to write the following quantities as numerals: 1 million, 10 million, 100 million, and so on, then use their list to help figure out how to say 296,600,000 in millions or to write 2,320 million as a numeral.\nStudents may think they do not have enough information to sketch a graph of \\(P\\). Encourage them to read through the activity to identify points that must be part of the graph of \\(P\\), but are not written in \\((x,y)\\) form.",

        "Activity Synthesis": "Select students to share their responses and sketches of the graph of \\(P\\).\nMake sure students can interpret a statement given in function notation,\u00a0such as \\(P(15) = 1,\\!860\\) or\u00a0\\(P(t)=1,\\!000\\), in terms of the situation and articulate it completely. For instance, students might say, \u201cThe output is 1,860 when the input is 15\u201d or \u201cWhen the input is \\(t\\) years, the output is 1,000 million,\u201d or some other variation that doesn\u2019t convey the quantities fully. Push them to refine their interpretation so that it is clear that \\(P(15) = 1,\\!860\\) means \u201c1.86 billion people owned a smartphone in the year 2015\u201d and \\(P(t)=1,\\!000\\) means \u201cA billion people owned a smartphone \\(t\\) years after the year 2000.\u201d\nWhen discussing possible graphs of \\(P\\), acknowledge that a graph of \\(P\\) could be drawn in various ways. The information we have is limited to the four input-output pairs, so what happens between the points is up for\u00a0interpretation. But it would make sense, based on the context, for the graph to show very little change before year 2010 and then a rapid increase afterward.\nThe purpose of the activity is to familiarize students with function notation and its use in context. If time allows, these additional questions about modeling a context may be discussed.\n\u201cThe output of \\(P\\) is defined in terms of \u2018millions of people\u2019 instead of individual persons. What\u00a0might be a reason for this?\u201d (If the unit is \u201cpersons,\u201d the scale would show very long numbers with 9 or 10 digits each, which would be much harder to read and might lead to mistakes. Using \u201cin thousands\u201d or \u201cin millions\u201d strategically makes it possible to use simpler numbers. It makes it easier to draw attention to important characteristics of a graph.)\n\u201cThe input is defined in \u2018years after 2000.\u2019 Could we have instead used calendar years, such as 2002?\u201d (Yes.)\n\u201cWhat might be a reason to choose \u2018years after 2000\u2019 as the unit?\u201d (It allows us to write smaller numbers. Another reason is that sometimes knowing a duration is more useful than knowing a particular point in time at which something happens. For instance, in the drone activity, knowing the number of seconds that had passed before the drone landed was more useful than knowing that it landed at, say, 2:45 p.m. In this activity, the year 2000 might be significant in the development of smartphones, so measuring time with that starting point might be useful.)\n\u201cWould it make sense to use a line of best fit based on the 4 known points?\u201d (Not in this case. The function should contain these points, not just model the information with a line. Also, it doesn\u2019t make sense for this information to follow a linear pattern.)"

The work here prompts students to reason quantitatively and abstractly (MP2).\nStudents take turns explaining their interpretation of statements in function notation and making sense of their partner\u2019s interpretation, discussing their differences if they disagree. In so doing, students practice constructing logical arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others (MP3).\nIdentify students who can correctly interpret statements such as \\(W(15) > W(30)\\) in terms of the situation and in relation to the graph of the function.
