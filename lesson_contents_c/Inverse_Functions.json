The reasoning they do here paves the way for thinking about reversing the process that defines a function and about using outputs as inputs. This will get students ready to make sense of the inverse of a function. It is not essential that students decode the message. What is important is the awareness that cracking the code involves a reversal process.",

If students struggle to get started after some time, consider giving a clue or two: The letters A and I are the only two letters that can stand on their own (each letter can be a word). The word \u201cis\u201d is the most common two-letter word in the English language. Leave time for class discussion, even if students have not yet managed to decipher the code at that time.",

        "activity_synthesis": "If one or more students were able to decode the message, ask them to share their result and how they went about decoding it. Otherwise, solicit some comments on the strategies they tried and any hypotheses on how the message was encoded. (Students are likely to hypothesize that the code is related to the position number of each letter in the alphabet.) Then, reveal the original message. Give students a brief moment to think about how it was coded. Discuss questions such as: \"Suppose you found out that each letter in the message was encoded by using the letter 3 places after the original letter. How would you decode the secret message?\" (By using the letter 3 places before that coded letter.) \"The code JRRG IRRG is produced with the same method. What does it say?\" (GOOD FOOD) \"What about EDEB?\" (BABY) Introduce Caesar shift cipher (or shift cipher) as a way to encrypt a message by shifting its alphabet position a certain number of places. The message in the Warm-up is called \"a shift of 3\" because it substitutes each letter in the original message with the letter 3 places after. A table could be used as a key.\u00a0It enables us to easily see the plain-text alphabet and the cipher-text alphabet. Here is an example for a shift of 3. plain text | cipher text A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | A | B | C A similar table could be used as a key for a shift of 5, 2, -3, or any other number.

Students convert values in one currency into another and then the other way around. They make sense of the former as a function and the latter as the inverse of the first function. The reasoning here builds on students' prior work on solving equations for a variable. Earlier in the course, students had isolated a variable to highlight a quantity or make it easier to compute the values of the variable. What is new here is the idea of inverse function: the recognition that a variable that is an output in one function (the one that is isolated) is an input in the inverse function, and vice versa. Some students may choose to graph the first function (\\(y=39.77s\\)) and use the graph to find all the unknown values in either currency. Making graphing technology available gives students an opportunity to choose appropriate tools strategically (MP5).",

By solving for \\(y\\).) \"In the first function, which variable is the input and which is the output?\" (Amount in yen is the input, and amount in soles\u00a0is the output.) \"In the inverse function, which variable is the input and which is the output?\" (Amount in soles is the input, and amount in yen\u00a0is the output.)

Explain that if we trace the graphs using graphing technology, we will see that all the values of all the coordinate pairs are reversed. ## Lesson Synthesis To help students synthesize the key ideas in this lesson, discuss questions such as: \"The amount of money in cents, \\(c\\), is a function of the amount in dollars, \\(d\\). What equation can we write to represent this function?\" (\\(c = 100d\\)) \"How can we find the inverse function?\" (We can reverse the process and solve for \\(d\\). To find the amount in cents, \\(c\\), we multiply the dollar amount, \\(d\\) by 100. To find the inverse, we divide the amount in cents by 100.) \"Why might it be helpful to find the inverse function, in this case?\" (If we know an amount in cents, we can find the amount in dollars. It gives us the amount in dollars as a function of the amount in cents.) \"Let's say\u00a0\\(d=7w\\) represents a function that gives\u00a0the number of days, \\(d\\), in \\(w\\) weeks. A student says that the inverse function is \\(w=7d\\) because now the variables are switched. Do you agree? Why or why not?\" (No. To find the number of days in \\(w\\) weeks, we multiply \\(w\\) by 7. So to find the number of weeks, \\(w\\), in \\(d\\) days, we need to divide \\(d\\) by 7, not multiply \\(d\\) by 7.) \"In general, how can you check if two functions are inverses?\" (We can check if the process\u00a0done to get the output of the original function gets reversed in the inverse function. If \\(a\\) is the input in the original function and it gives \\(b\\) for the output, we can see if putting \\(b\\) in the inverse function gives \\(a\\) for the output.) ## Student Lesson Summary Sometimes it is useful to reverse a function so that the original output is now the input. Suppose Han lives 400 meters from school and walks to school. A linear function gives Han's distance to school, \\(D\\), in meters, after he has walked \\(w\\) meters from home, and is defined by: \\(D= 400 - w\\) With this equation, if we know how far Han has walked from home, \\(w\\), we can easily find his remaining distance to school, \\(D\\). Here, \\(w\\) is the input, and \\(D\\) is the output. What if we know Han's remaining distance to school, \\(D\\), and want to know how far he has walked, \\(w\\)? We can find out by solving for \\(w\\): \\(\\begin {align} D &= 400 - w\\\\ D+w &= 400\\\\ w &=400 - D \\end{align}\\) The equation \\(w=400-D\\) represents the inverse of the original function. With this equation, we can easily find how far Han has walked from home if we know his remaining distance to school. Here, \\(w\\) and \\(D\\) have switched roles: \\(w\\) is now the output, and \\(D\\)\u00a0is the input. In general, if a function takes \\(a\\) as its input and gives \\(b\\) as its output, its inverse function takes \\(b\\) as the input and \\(a\\) as the output.  "
