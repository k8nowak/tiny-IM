They have also rearranged equations to isolate a particular variable. This Warm-up activates that prior knowledge, preparing students to write equations for linear functions that involve two or more operations, and then to write their inverses. To ensure access, the equations students are expected to write are scaffolded\u2014starting with one operation and moving to two operations, from using numbers and letters to using only letters. The scaffolding also allows students to see structure in the equations, which would be helpful when they try to reverse the process.",

Students are given an equation that defines the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit as a function of the temperature in degrees Celsius (\\(F = \\frac59 C+32\\)) and are asked to find some temperatures in both units. Using this equation to find a temperature in degrees Celsius involves substituting the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for \\(F\\) and solving the equation. Students do so several times over. The regularity in repeated reasoning with numerical values (MP8) paves the way for students to write the equation for the inverse function, which entails solving for \\(C\\) before substituting values of \\(F\\). Students are also prompted to verify that two unfamiliar equations represent inverse functions. To do so, students need to analyze the structure of one equation, use it to reverse the process that defines the function, and see if the reversal leads to the other equation (MP7).",

            "activity_synthesis": "Invite students to share their response and reasoning. Make sure students see that because the number of seats, \\(S\\), is found by multiplying the number of table, \\(n\\), by 4 and then adding 2, the inverse function can be found by subtracting 2 from \\(S\\) and then dividing the result by 4. Discuss with students: \"Why are 23 tables needed for 94 guests but 24 tables needed for just 1 more guest?\" (Entering 95 for \\(S\\) in the equation \\(n=\\frac{S-2}{4}\\)\u00a0gives \\(n=23\\frac14\\), but a fractional value of \\(n\\) does not make sense in this situation, so one more table is needed, though there will be open seats.) \"The range of the first function, the set of \\(S\\)-values, is numbers that are 2 more than multiples of 4 (6, 10, 14, . . .). In the inverse function, is the domain limited to the same set of \\(S\\)-values? Or are numbers like 17 and 85 also possible inputs?\" Highlight that\u00a0just as solutions to equations need to be interpreted in context, so do the domain and range of a function and its inverse. The equation for the first function, \\(S=4n+2\\), tells us the number of seats at \\(n\\) tables, assuming all the tables are filled completely and regardless of whether the seats are occupied by guests. The range values of 6, 10, 14, . . . reflect these assumptions. The equation for the inverse function, \\(n=\\frac{S-2}{4}\\), gives the number of tables if we know the number of seats, \\(S\\), but we don't assume that the seats completely fill each table. The domain of the inverse function (the set of \\(S\\)-values) could include any whole number (not just 6, 10, 14, . . . ). When an input gives a fractional number of table for the output (such as \\(n=23\\frac14\\)), we need to interpret it in terms of the situation. ## Lesson Synthesis Display for all to see the equations representing the temperature function and that for its inverse. \\(F = \\frac95 C + 32\\) \\(C = (F-32) \\boldcdot \\frac59\\) Ask students questions, such as: \"How can we use the first equation to find the temperature in degrees Celsius when the temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit? What about when it is 78 degrees Fahrenheit?\" (Substitute \\(F\\) for 50 and 78, respectively, and then solve the equation.) \"How can we use the second equation to answer the same questions?\" (Evaluate that equation at \\(F=50\\) and \\(F=78\\).) \"When is the first equation more useful?\" (When we know the temperature in degrees Celsius and want to find the equivalent in degrees Fahrenheit.) \"When is the second equation more useful?\" (When we know the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and want to find it in degrees Celsius.) Highlight that finding the inverse of a function is particularly useful when we have multiple outputs for which we wish to find the inputs. Evaluating a function at a value (using the equation for the inverse) is much more efficient than solving an equation (using the original equation). ## Student Lesson Summary It is helpful to interpret the inverse of a function in terms of a situation and the quantities it represents. Suppose a linear function gives the dollar cost, \\(C\\), of renting some equipment for \\(n\\) hours. The function is defined by this equation: \\(C = 8.25n+30\\) If we know the number of hours of rental, \\(n\\), we can substitute it into the expression \\(8.25n+30\\) and evaluate it to find the cost, \\(C\\). What is the inverse of this function, and what does it tell us about the length and cost of rental? To find the inverse, let's solve for \\(n\\): \\(\\begin {align} 8.25n + 30 &= C\\\\ 8.25n &=C-30\\\\ n&=\\dfrac {C-30}{8.25} \\end{align}\\) If we know the cost of rental, \\(C\\), we can substitute it into the expression \\(\\dfrac {C-30}{8.25}\\) and evaluate it to find the hours of rental, \\(n\\). Notice that the equation defining the inverse function is found by reversing the process that defines the original linear function. The original rule, \\(C=8.25n + 30\\), tells us to multiply the input, \\(n\\), by 8.25 and add 30 to the result to get the output, \\(C\\). The rule of the inverse function, \\(\\dfrac {C-30}{8.25}\\), suggests that we subtract 30 from the input and then divide the result by 8.25 to get the output \\(n\\).  "
