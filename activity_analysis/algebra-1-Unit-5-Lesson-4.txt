Warm-Up: Notice and Wonder: Two Functions
Timing: 5 minutes

Task Statement:
What do you notice? What do you wonder? \(x\) | \(f(x)=10-2x\) 1 | 8 1.5 | 7 5 | 0 -2 | 14 \(x\) | \(g(x)=x^3\) -2 | -8 0 | 0 1 | 1 3 | 27

Takeaway:
Understand how to interpret and describe the structure of functions using function notation.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs. 

2. Display the tables for \\(f(x) = 10 - 2x\\) and \\(g(x) = x^3\\).

3. Students take 1 minute to think of at least one thing they notice and one thing they wonder.

4. Students discuss with their partner for 1 minute.

5. Students share what they noticed and wondered; teacher records all responses visibly.

6. Encourage students to ask for clarification, point out contradictions, and voice disagreements.


Activity 1: Four Functions
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Here are descriptions and equations that represent four functions. \(f(x)=3x-7\\\) \(g(x)=3(x-7)\\\) \(h(x)=\frac{x}{3}-7\\\) \(k(x)=\dfrac{x-7}{3}\\\) A. To get the output, subtract 7 from the input, then divide the result by 3. B. To get the output, subtract 7 from the input, then multiply the result by 3. C. To get the output, multiply the input by 3, then subtract 7 from the result. D. To get the output, divide the input by 3, then subtract 7 from the result. Match each equation with a verbal description that represents the same function. Record your results. For one of the functions, when the input is 6, the output is -3. Which is that function: \(f, g\), \(h\), or \(k\)? Explain how you know. Which of the four functions have the greatest value when the input is 0? What about when the input is 10?

Takeaway:
Match algebraic functions to their verbal descriptions.

Steps:
1. Display “function machine” image with rule “cube the input."
2. Ask students to find outputs for 0, 1, 3, and \\( x \\) using function \\( g(x)=x^3 \\).
3. Explain that functions can be expressed with words or expressions.
4. Give students descriptions and equations of four functions.
5. Students match equations \\( f, g, h, k \\) with descriptions A, B, C, D.
6. Discuss and compare results, focusing on order of operations and evaluating inputs.


Activity 2: Rules for Area and Perimeter

Takeaway:
**Understand the relationship between quantities using function notation to describe and graph area and perimeter rules.**

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs.
2. Give students a few minutes to work on the first set of questions individually, then discuss with their partner.
3. Pause for group discussion; ask students to share their area function rule \\(A(s) = s^2\\).
4. Have students complete the table, write the rule \\(P(\\ell) = 2\\ell + 6\\), and graph the perimeter function.
5. Select students to share their perimeter function rules and discuss their equivalence.
6. Discuss how the graph relates to the perimeter rule and its slope and intercept.
