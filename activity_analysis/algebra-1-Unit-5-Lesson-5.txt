Warm-Up: Make It True
Timing: 5 minutes

Task Statement:
Consider the equation \(q = 4 + 0.8p\). What value of \(q\) would make the equation true when:\(p\) is 7?\(p\) is 100? What value of \(q\) would make the equation true when: \(p\) is 7? \(p\) is 100? What value of \(p\) would make the equation true when:\(q\) is 12?\(q\) is 60? What value of \(p\) would make the equation true when: \(q\) is 12? \(q\) is 60? Be prepared to explain or show your reasoning.

Takeaway:
Evaluate and solve equations to find the values that make the equations true.

Steps:
1. Present equation \\(q = 4 + 0.8p\\).
2. Students solve for \\(q\\) when \\(p = 7\\) and \\(p = 100\\).
3. Students solve for \\(p\\) when \\(q = 12\\) and \\(q = 60\\).
4. Discuss solutions and strategies used, highlighting solving the equation for \\(p\\).


Activity 1: Gaming Options
Timing: 25 minutes

Task Statement:
Elena is looking at options for video game consoles. Each option begins with a purchase of the console and a 1 month free trial period of the online gaming service. The monthly cost of each option can be seen as a function and represented with an equation: Option A: \(A(x) = 600\) Option B: \(B(x) = 10x + 250\) In each function, the input, \(x\), represents the number of months Elena uses the online gaming service after the free trial period. Elena decides to find the values of \(A(1)\) and \(B(1)\) and compare them. What are those values? When planning her budget, she compares \(A(7.5)\) and \(B(7.5)\). What are those values? Describe each option in words. Graph each function on the same coordinate plane. Then, explain which option you think she should choose.	​​​​​​​​​​​ ​​​​​ Image description: <p>Blank grid. Horizontal axis, 0 to 90, months after trial. Vertical axis, 0 to 900 by 100’s, cost, dollars.</p> ​​​​​​ Elena budgeted only \$280 for the console and online service. She thought, “I wonder how many months I could have for \$280 if I go with Option B” and wrote \(B(x) = 280\). What is the answer to her question? Explain or show how you know.

Takeaway:
Understand and solve linear functions in context.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs, read the opening paragraphs and first question together.
2. Discuss what \\(A(1)\\) and \\(B(1)\\) represent in this situation with a partner and class. 
3. Ensure students understand input value represents months after the trial period and explain prorated charges.
4. Students compute \\(A(1)\\) and \\(B(1)\\), and then compare \\(A(7.5)\\) and \\(B(7.5)\\) in groups.
5. Graph each function on a coordinate plane and discuss option preferences.
6. Solve \\(B(x) = 280\\) to determine the number of months for Option B, share solution strategies.
7. Synthesize learning, ensuring understanding of linear functions, slope, intercept, and discuss possible choices.


Activity 2: Function Notation and Graphing Technology
Timing: 20 minutes

Task Statement:
The function \(B\) is defined by the equation \(B(x) = 10x + 25\). Use graphing technology to: Find the value of each expression:\(B(6)\)\(B(2.75)\)\(B(1.482)\) Find the value of each expression: \(B(6)\) \(B(2.75)\) \(B(1.482)\) Solve each equation:\(B(x) = 93\)\(B(x) = 42.1\)\(B(x) = 116.25\) Solve each equation: \(B(x) = 93\) \(B(x) = 42.1\) \(B(x) = 116.25\)

Takeaway:
Understand how to use graphing technology to evaluate functions and solve equations using function notation.

Steps:
1. Demonstrate graphing \\(B(x) = 10x + 25\\) using technology.
2. Show how to find function values \\(B(1.482)\\) and solve for \\(x\\) in \\(B(x) = 103.75\\) using graphing tools.
3. Assign students tasks to graph, find specific values \\(B(6)\\), \\(B(2.75)\\), \\(B(1.482)\\), and solve \\(B(x) = 93\\), \\(B(x) = 42.1\\), \\(B(x) = 116.25\\).
4. Facilitate students sharing insights and discuss the efficiency and limitations of using graphing technology.
5. Compare graphical and algebraic methods for finding unknown inputs and outputs.
6. Discuss how technology can aid in precision and efficiency in solving function problems.
