Warm-Up: Population Growth
Timing: 5 minutes

Task Statement:
This graph shows the populations of Baltimore and Cleveland in the 20th century. \(B(t)\) is the population of Baltimore in year \(t\). \(C(t)\) is the population of Cleveland in year \(t\). Image description: <p>Two functions. year and population.</p> Estimate \(B(1930)\), and explain what it means in this situation. Here are pairs of statements about the two populations. In each pair, which statement is true? Be prepared to explain how you know.\(B(2000) > C(2000)\) or \(B(2000) < C(2000)\)\(B(1900) = C(1900)\) or \(B(1900) > C(1900)\) Here are pairs of statements about the two populations. In each pair, which statement is true? Be prepared to explain how you know. \(B(2000) > C(2000)\) or \(B(2000) < C(2000)\) \(B(1900) = C(1900)\) or \(B(1900) > C(1900)\) Were the two cities’ populations ever the same? If so, when?

Takeaway:
Interpret and compare population functions using graphs and function notation.

Steps:
1. Show graph of Baltimore and Cleveland populations.
2. Estimate \\(B(1930)\\); explain its meaning (population ~800,000).
3. Compare pairs of statements: 
    - \\(B(2000) > C(2000)\\) or \\(B(2000) < C(2000)\\)
    - \\(B(1900) = C(1900)\\) or \\(B(1900) > C(1900)\\)
4. Determine if/when the populations were equal.
5. Discuss answers and function notation (\\(B(t)=C(t)\\) for \\(t=1910\\)).


Activity 1: Wired or Wireless?
Timing: 20 minutes

Task Statement:
\(H(t)\) is the percentage of homes in the United States that have a landline phone in year \(t\). \(C(t)\) is the percentage of homes with only a cell phone. Here are the graphs of \(H\) and \(C\). Graph of 2 functions. Blue solid line, H of t, represents percentage of homes in US with a landline phone in year t. Red dotted line, C of t, represents the percentage of homes with only a cell phone. H of 2006 is about 85. C of 2006 is about 14. C of 2008= 20. Lines intersect in 2015. The rate of increase in percentage of cell phones is increasing at approximately the same rate as the rate of home phones is decreasing. Image description: <p>Graph of 2 functions. Blue solid line represents percentage of homes in US with a landline phone in year t. Red dotted line represents the percentage of homes with <em>only</em> a cell phone.</p> Estimate \(H(2006)\) and \(C(2006)\). Explain what each value tells us about the phones. What is the approximate solution to \(C(t)=20\)? Explain what the solution means in this situation. Determine if each equation is true. Be prepared to explain how you know.\(C(2011) = H(2011)\)\(C(2015) = H(2015)\) Determine if each equation is true. Be prepared to explain how you know. \(C(2011) = H(2011)\) \(C(2015) = H(2015)\) Between 2004 and 2015, did the percentage of homes with landlines decrease at the same rate at which the percentage of cell-phones-only homes increased? Explain or show your reasoning.

Takeaway:
Understand how to interpret and compare rates of change and intersection points of functions in a contextual situation.

Steps:
1. Ask students about landline vs. cell phone ownership.
2. Show and discuss the graphs of \\(H(t)\\) and \\(C(t)\\).
3. Estimate and interpret \\(H(2006)\\) and \\(C(2006)\\).
4. Solve \\(C(t) = 20\\) and explain its context.
5. Verify and explain the truth of \\(C(2011) = H(2011)\\) and \\(C(2015) = H(2015)\\).
6. Discuss the average rate of change and its meaning.
7. (Optional) Discuss why the rates of change for landlines and cell phones are similar.
