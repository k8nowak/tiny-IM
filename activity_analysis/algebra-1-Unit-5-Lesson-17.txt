Warm-Up: Water in a Tank
Timing: 5 minutes

Task Statement:
A tank contained some water. The function \(w\) represents the relationship between \(t\), time in minutes, and the amount of water in the tank in liters. The equation \(w(t) = 80 - 2.5t\) defines this function. Discuss with a partner:How is the water in the tank changing? Be as specific as possible. What does \(w(t)\) represent? Is \(w(t)\) the input or the output of this function? Discuss with a partner: How is the water in the tank changing? Be as specific as possible. What does \(w(t)\) represent? Is \(w(t)\) the input or the output of this function? Sketch a graph of the function. Be sure to label the axes. Image description: <p>Blank grid, origin O.</p>

Takeaway:
Interpret and graph a linear function with a negative rate of change.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs; provide calculators if requested.
2. Discuss with a partner how the water level in the tank is changing. Identify \\(w(t)\\) as the output and \\(t\\) as the input.
3. Sketch and label axes on the graph of \\(w(t) = 80 - 2.5t\\).
4. Select pairs to share their graphs and interpretations.
5. Ensure students understand that \\(w(t)\\) is the output, the equation models water decrease, and why the graph slopes downward.


Activity 1: Another Look at the Tank
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
A tank contained 80 liters of water. The function \(w\) represents the relationship between \(t\), time in minutes, and the amount of water in the tank in liters. The equation \(w(t) = 80 - 2.5t\) defines this function. How much water will be in the tank after 13 minutes? How many minutes will it take until the tank has 5 liters of water? In this situation, what information can we gain from the inverse of function \(w\)? Find the inverse of function \(w\). Be prepared to explain or show your reasoning. How would the graph of the inverse function of \(w\) compare to the graph of \(w\)? Describe or sketch your prediction.

Takeaway:
Understand and interpret the inverse of a function represented using function notation.

Steps:
1. Remind students function notation (e.g., \\(w(t)\\)) and inverse functions.
2. Present the task: \\(w(t) = 80 - 2.5t\\).
3. Students calculate water after 13 minutes and time to reach 5 liters.
4. Find and interpret the inverse function: \\(t = \\frac{80 - w(t)}{2.5}\\).
5. Discuss and predict the graph of the inverse function \\(w\\).
6. Display and analyze graphs of both \\(w\\) and its inverse.


Activity 2: Phones in Homes
Timing: 20 minutes

Task Statement:
In 2004, less than 5% of the homes in the United States relied on a cell phone instead of a landline phone. Since then, the percentage of homes that used only cell phones has increased. Here are the percentages of homes with only cell phones from 2004 to 2009. years since 2004 | percentages 0 | 4.4 1 | 6.7 2 | 9.6 3 | 13.6 4 | 17.5 5 | 22.7 Graph of data, origin O. Horizontal axis, 0 to 5, years since 2004. Vertical axis, 0 to 24, percentage. Data points at 0 comma 4 point 4, 1 comma 6 point 7, 2 comma 9 point 6, 3 comma 13 point 6, 4 comma 17 point 5, and 5 comma 22 point 7.​​​​​​ Image description: <p>Graph of data, origin O.</p> Suppose a linear function, \(P\), gives us the percentage of homes with only cell phones as a function of years since 2004, \(t\).Fit a line on the scatter plot to represent this function, and write an equation that could define the function. Use function notation. Suppose a linear function, \(P\), gives us the percentage of homes with only cell phones as a function of years since 2004, \(t\). Fit a line on the scatter plot to represent this function, and write an equation that could define the function. Use function notation. Use your equation to find the value of \(P(6)\). Then, explain what it means in this situation. Use your equation to solve \(P(t) = 30\) for \(t\). What does the solution represent? Suppose we want to know when the percentage of homes with only cell phones would reach 50%, 75%, or 100% (assuming that the trend continues and the function stays valid). What equation could be written to help us find the years that correspond to those percentages? Show your reasoning.

Takeaway:
'Understand and apply the concept of finding and using the inverse of a function to solve real-world problems.'

Steps:
1. Arrange students in groups of 2–3; provide graphing tools if requested.
2. Students plot given data on a scatter plot.
3. Students fit a line to the data and write the linear function using slope-intercept form.
4. Students use their function to find \\(P(6)\\) and interpret its meaning.
5. Students solve \\(P(t) = 30\\) for \\(t\\) and interpret the result.
6. Discuss results: focus on solving for \\(t\\) and identifying inverse functions.
