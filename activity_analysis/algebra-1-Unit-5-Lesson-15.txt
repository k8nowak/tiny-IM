Warm-Up: What Does It Say?
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Here is an encoded message, a message that has been converted into a code. WRGDB LV D JRRG GDB. Can you figure out what it says in English? How was the original message encoded?

Takeaway:
Understand how to reverse the process of a function, using a shift cipher as a model.

Steps:
1. Briefly introduce ciphers or coded messages.
2. Present encoded message: WRGDB LV D JRRG GDB.
3. Give students quiet think time to decode the message.
4. Offer clues if needed: A and I can be words, “is” is common.
5. Discuss strategies, hypotheses, and reveal original message.
6. Explain decoding with a Caesar shift cipher (shift of 3).


Activity 1: Caesar Says, “Shift”
Timing: 15 minutes

Task Statement:
Now it’s your turn to write a secret code!Write a short and friendly message with 3–4 words.Pick a number from 1 to 10. Then, encode your message by shifting each letter that many steps forward or backward in the alphabet, wrapping around from Z to A as needed.Complete these tables to create a key for your cipher.position in the alphabet12345678910111213letter in the messageABCDEFGH I  J KLMletter in codeposition in the alphabet14151617181920212223242526letter in the messageNOPQRSTUVWXYZletter in codeGive your encoded message to a partner to decode.

Takeaway:
Understand inverse functions through cipher encoding and decoding.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs.
2. Each student writes a 3-4 word message and encodes it using a shift cipher (pick a shift number 1-10).
3. Students exchange encoded messages with their partner; decode each other's message using the shift number.
4. Complete provided tables to aid in encoding/decoding and translate letters to numbers.
5. Discuss as a class: Share equations on encoding/decoding and identify input/output relationships.
6. Define encoding and decoding as inverse functions.


Activity 2: Japanese Yen and Peruvian Soles
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
A Japanese traveler who is heading to Peru exchanges some Japanese yen for Peruvian soles. At the time of his travel, 1 yen can be exchanged for 39.77 soles. At the same time, a Peruvian businesswoman who is in Japan is exchanging some Peruvian soles for Japanese yen at the same exchange rate. Image description: Japanese yen and Peruvian soles. Find the amount of money in soles that the Japanese traveler would get if he exchanged:100 yen500 yen Find the amount of money in soles that the Japanese traveler would get if he exchanged: 100 yen 500 yen Write an equation that gives the amount of money in soles, \(s\), as a function of the amount of money in yen, \(y\), being exchanged. Find the amount that the Peruvian businesswoman would get if she exchanged:1,000 soles5,000 soles Find the amount that the Peruvian businesswoman would get if she exchanged: 1,000 soles 5,000 soles Explain why it might be helpful to write the inverse of the function you wrote earlier. Then, write an equation that defines the inverse function.

Takeaway:
Understand and apply the concept of inverse functions using currency exchange rates.

Steps:
1. Students work quietly for a few minutes, then discuss as a class.
2. Students convert yen to soles and vice versa at an exchange rate of 1 yen = 39.77 soles.
3. Write function \\( s = 39.77y \\) and inverse function.
4. Graph both functions, observe and discuss differences.
5. Whole-class discussion focusing on defining inverse functions and switching input-output roles.
6. Ask synthesis questions to consolidate understanding of inverse functions with another example.
