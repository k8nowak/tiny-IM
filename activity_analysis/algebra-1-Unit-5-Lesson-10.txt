Warm-Up: Number of Barks
Timing: 5 minutes

Task Statement:
The total number of times a dog has barked is a function of the time, in seconds, after its owner tied its leash to a post and left. Less than 3 minutes after he left, the owner returned, untied the leash, and walked away with the dog. Could each value be an input of the function? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.15\(84\frac12\)300 Could each value be an input of the function? Be prepared to explain your reasoning. 15 \(84\frac12\) 300 Could each value be an output of the function? Be prepared to explain your reasoning.15\(84\frac12\)300 Could each value be an output of the function? Be prepared to explain your reasoning. 15 \(84\frac12\) 300

Takeaway:
Understand domain and range of a function.

Steps:
1. Present the scenario: dog barks as a function of time tied to a post.
2. Ask if these can be inputs: 15, 84.5, 300—explain why.
3. Ask if these can be outputs: 15, 84.5, 300—explain why.
4. Share and discuss responses highlighting the upper limit of inputs (180 seconds) and the issue with fractional outputs.
5. Optional: Discuss when functions begin and end if time permits.
6. Transition to exploring valid inputs and outputs for different functions in lesson.


Activity 1: Card Sort: Possible or Impossible?
Timing: 20 minutes

Task Statement:
Your teacher will give you a set of cards that each contain a number. Decide whether each number is a possible input for the functions described here. Sort the cards into two groups—possible inputs and impossible inputs. Record your sorting decisions. The area of a square, in square centimeters, is a function of its side length, \(s\), in centimeters. The equation \(A(s) = s^2\) defines this function.Possible inputs:Impossible inputs: The area of a square, in square centimeters, is a function of its side length, \(s\), in centimeters. The equation \(A(s) = s^2\) defines this function. Possible inputs: Impossible inputs: A tennis camp charges $40 per student for a full-day camp. The camp runs only if at least 5 students sign up, and it limits the enrollment to 16 campers a day. The amount of revenue, in dollars, that the tennis camp collects is a function of the number of students that enroll.The equation \(R(n) = 40n\) defines this function.Possible inputs:Impossible inputs: A tennis camp charges $40 per student for a full-day camp.

Takeaway:
Understand how to determine the domain of a function by identifying possible and impossible inputs.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs and give each pair a set of pre-cut cards.
2. Students sort the cards into categories of their choosing in 1 minute.
3. Pause and have groups share their sorted categories; discuss and clarify number types (positive, negative, integers, rational).
4. For each function (area, revenue, temperature), students sort numbers into possible and impossible inputs and record results.
5. Select groups to share sorting results and display them.
6. Discuss the domain for each function and clarify any disagreements; introduce the concept of domain explicitly.


Activity 2: What about the Outputs?
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
In an earlier activity, you saw a function representing the area of a square (function \(A\)) and another representing the revenue of a tennis camp (function \(R\)). Refer to the descriptions of those functions to answer these questions. Here is a graph that represents function \(A\), defined by \(A(s) = s^2\), where \(s\) is the side length of the square in centimeters.	A graph with origin O. The horizontal axis, side length, centimeters, scale from 0 to 8 by 0.5’s. The vertical axis, area, square centimeters, scale from 0 to 50 by 25s. A curve, trending up and to the right, passes through the points 0 comma 0, 4 comma 16, and 6 comma 36.Name three possible input-output pairs of this function.Earlier we described the set of all possible input values of \(A\) as “any number greater than or equal to 0.” How would you describe the set of all possible output values of \(A\)?

Takeaway:
Understand the range of a function and how it relates to the domain and features of its graph.

Steps:
1. Group students into pairs or small groups (2-4).
2. Have students work quietly for a few minutes on given functions and graphs.
3. Let students share their responses within their groups.
4. Facilitate a whole-class discussion on the range of functions \\(A\\) and \\(R\\).
5. Ensure students understand that the range is all possible output values and how it relates to the domain.
6. Clarify which graph correctly represents function \\(R\\) and why, emphasizing the correct plotting method.
7. If time permits, discuss the domain and range of the temperature function \\(k(c) = c + 273.15\\).


Activity 3: What Could Be the Trouble?
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Consider the function \(f(x)=\dfrac {6}{x-2}\). To find out the sets of possible input and output values of the function, Clare created a table and evaluated \(f\) at some values of \(x\). Along the way, she ran into some trouble. Find \(f(x)\) for each \(x\)-value Clare listed. Describe what Clare’s trouble might be.\(x\)-100\(\frac12\)28\(f(x)\) Find \(f(x)\) for each \(x\)-value Clare listed. Describe what Clare’s trouble might be. \(x\) | \(f(x)\) -10 | 0 | \(\frac12\) | 2 | 8 |  |  |  | Use graphing technology to graph function \(f\). What do you notice about the graph? Use a calculator to compute the value you and Clare had trouble computing. What do you notice about the computation? How would you describe the domain of function \(f\)?

Takeaway:
Understand that the domain of a function is the set of all possible input values and that division by zero is undefined.

Steps:
### Steps for "What Could Be the Trouble?" Activity

1. **Distribute Devices**: Ensure each student has a device with graphing capabilities.
2. **Evaluate Function**: Students calculate \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{6}{x-2}\\) for given \\(x\\)-values (-10, 0, 0.5, 2, 8).
3. **Identify Problem**: Students describe any issues encountered (e.g., \\(x = 2\\)).
4. **Graph Function**: Use graphing technology to visualize \\(f(x)\\).
5. **Observation & Discussion**: Discuss graph behavior and problematic values (division by zero).
6. **Define Domain**: Conclude that the domain excludes the value making the denominator zero (exclude \\(x = 2\\)).

---

Remember: Highlight that \\(x = 2\\) leads to undefined output and thus is not a part of the function\
