Warm-Up: Temperature in Toronto
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Toronto is a city at the border of the United States and Canada, just north of Buffalo, New York. Here are twelve guesses of the average temperature of Toronto, in degrees Celsius, in February 2017. 5 2 -5 3 0 -1 1.5 4 -2.5 6 4 -0.5 The actual average temperature of Toronto in February 2017 is 0 degrees Celsius.Use this information to sketch a scatter plot representing the guesses, \(x\), and the corresponding absolute guessing errors, \(y\). The actual average temperature of Toronto in February 2017 is 0 degrees Celsius. Use this information to sketch a scatter plot representing the guesses, \(x\), and the corresponding absolute guessing errors, \(y\). Image description: <p>horizontal axis, guess. scale -8 to 8, by 1's. vertical axis, absolute guessing error. scale 0 to 8, by 1's. </p> What rule can you write to find the output given the input?

Takeaway:
Understand that the absolute guessing error can be represented as the absolute value of the difference between the guess and the actual value, \\(|x - a|\\).

Steps:
1. Hand out scatter plot template to students.
2. Have students plot each guess \\(x\\) and the absolute error \\(y = |x|\\).
3. Select a student to display their scatter plot and discuss.
4. Ask comparison questions on scatter plot properties and previous lessons.
5. Highlight formula \\(y = |x|\\) in context of actual temperature being 0°C.


Activity 1: The Distance Function
Timing: 15 minutes

Task Statement:
The function \(A\) gives the distance of \(x\) from 0 on the number line. Complete the table with at least one possible value in each blank position, and sketch a graph of function \(A\).	\(x\)\(A(x)\)85.6\(\pi\)\(\frac12\)10\(\text-\frac12\)-1-5.68 \(x\) | \(A(x)\) 8 | | 5.6 \(\pi\) | \(\frac12\) | | 1 0 | \(\text-\frac12\) | -1 | -5.6 | | 8 Image description: <p>Coordinate plane, x and y axis, scale -8 to 8, by 2's.</p> Andre and Elena are trying to write a rule for this function.Andre writes: \(A(x)=\begin{cases} x,& x \geq 0 \\ \text-x, & x < 0 \\ \end{cases}\)Elena writes: \(A(x) = |x|\)Explain why both equations correctly represent the function \(A\). Andre and Elena are trying to write a rule for this function. Andre writes: \(A(x)=\begin{cases} x,& x \geq 0 \\ \text-x, & x < 0 \\ \end{cases}\) Elena writes: \(A(x) = |x|\) Explain why both equations correctly represent the function \(A\).

Takeaway:
Understand that the absolute value function represents the distance of a number from zero and can be expressed using both absolute value notation and piecewise notation.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs.
2. Quietly complete the table and sketch a graph for function \\(A\\).
3. Share responses with a partner.
4. Whole-class discussion: ask selected students to display their graphs.
5. Emphasize the V-shape of the graph and explain why \\(A(x) = |x|\\) and \\(A(x) = \\begin{cases} x,& x \\geq 0 \\\\ \\text{-}x, & x < 0 \\end{cases}\\) represent the same function.


Activity 2: Moving Graphs Around
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Here are equations and graphs that represent five absolute value functions. \(f(x)=|x|\) Image description: <p>graph of f of x = the absolute value of x.</p> \(g(x)=|x-2|\) Image description: <p>graph of absolute value function with vertex at 2 comma 0.</p> \(h(x)=|x+2|\) Image description: <p>graph of absolute value function with vertex at -2 comma 0.</p> \(j(x)=|x|-2\) Image description: <p>graph of absolute value function with vertex at 0 comma -2.</p> \(k(x)=|x|+2\) Image description: <p>Graph of absolute value function with vertex on y axis up 2 units from the origin </p> Notice that the number 2 appears in the equations for functions \(g,h,j\), and \(k\). Describe how the addition or subtraction of 2 affects the graph of each function. Then, think about a possible explanation for the position of the graph. How can you show that it really belongs where it is on the coordinate plane?

Takeaway:
Understand how adding or subtracting a constant term affects the vertex and position of an absolute value function's graph.

Steps:
**Activity Steps for "Moving Graphs Around":**

1. **Introduction:**
   - Provide equations and graphs of absolute value functions \\(f(x)=|x|\\), \\(g(x)=|x-2|\\), \\(h(x)=|x+2|\\), \\(j(x)=|x|-2\\), \\(k(x)=|x|+2\\).
   
2. **Observation:**
   - Students analyze how the addition or subtraction of 2 affects each graph.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Encourage students to explain why the graphs are positioned as they are.

4. **Technological Aid:**
   - Use dynamic graphing tools for visual understanding if available.

5. **Student Sharing:**
   - Select students with varied strategies to present their reasoning.

6. **Synthesis:**
   - Discuss how \\( \\lvert x - 2 \\rvert \\) is connected to absolute error with a vertex at \\((2, 0)\\) and relate different functions to real-life scenarios.


Activity 3: More Moving Graphs Around
Timing: 15 minutes

Task Statement:
Here are five equations and four graphs. Equation 1: \(y=|x-3|\) Equation 2: \(y=|x-9|+3\) Equation 3: \(y=|x|-6\) Equation 4: \(y=|x+3|\) Equation 5: \(y=|x+3|-6\) A Image description: <p>Graph of absolute value function with vertex at 0 comma -6.</p> B Image description: <p>Graph of absolute value function with vertex at 3 comma 0.</p> C Image description: <p>Graph of absolute value function with vertex at -3 comma -6</p> D Image description: <p>graph of absolute value function with vertex at 9 comma 3.</p> Match each equation with a graph that represents it. One equation has no match. For the equation without a match, sketch a graph on the blank coordinate plane. Use graphing technology to check your matches and your graph. Revise your matches and graphs as needed.

Takeaway:
Understand how adding or subtracting constants before and after the absolute value function shifts its graph horizontally and vertically.

Steps:
1. Provide devices for Desmos or graphing tech.
2. Show students five equations and four graphs.
3. Students match equations with graphs, and sketch a graph for the unmatched equation.
4. Verify their matches and graph using technology.
5. Discuss different strategies students used for matching.
6. If time, have students describe graphs for new functions, focusing on horizontal and vertical shifts.
