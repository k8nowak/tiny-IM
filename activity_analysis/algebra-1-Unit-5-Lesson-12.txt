Warm-Up: Frozen Yogurt
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
A self-serve frozen yogurt store sells servings up to 12 ounces. It charges \$0.50 per ounce for a serving between 0 and 8 ounces and \$4 for any serving greater than 8 ounces and up to 12 ounces. Choose the graph that represents the price as a function of the weight of a serving of yogurt. Be prepared to explain how you know. A Image description: <p>Horizontal axis, ounces of yogurt.

2. Show students 4 graphs of price vs. weight. Have them pick the correct graph.
3. Discuss the cost of servings: 4 ounces ($2), 8 ounces ($4), 10 ounces ($4).
4. Explain piecewise functions and how different rules apply to different parts of the domain.
5. Demonstrate "cases" notation for the piecewise function.

What do you know about the weight of the letter? Kiran and Mai wrote some rules to represent the postage function, but each of them made some errors with the domain.\(\displaystyle K(w) = \begin{cases} 0.50, & 0\leq w\leq 1 \\ 0.71, & 1\leq w\leq 2 \\ 0.92, & 2\leq w\leq 3\\ 1.13, & 3\leq w\leq 3.5\\ \end{cases} \)\(\displaystyle M(w) = \begin{cases} 0.50, & 0< w< 1 \\ 0.71, & 1< w< 2 \\ 0.92, & 2< w< 3\\ 1.13, & 3< w< 3.5\\ \end{cases}\)	Identify the error in each person’s work, and write a corrected set of rules.

Takeaway:
Interpret piecewise functions and correctly use inequality symbols based on graph features.

Steps:
1. Display and discuss the piecewise function graph with the class.
2. Arrange students in pairs. Allow quiet time, then discussion on initial graph questions.
3. Pause for whole-class discussion on interpreting open and closed circles on the graph.
4. Have pairs analyze and correct the domain errors in Kiran's and Mai's function rules.
5. Conduct a class synthesis discussing errors, correct inequality symbols, and the cases based on the graph.
