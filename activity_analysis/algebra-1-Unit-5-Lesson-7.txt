Warm-Up: Temperature Drop
Timing: 5 minutes

Task Statement:
Here are the recorded temperatures at three different times on a winter evening. time | temperature 4 p.m. | 6 p.m. | 10 p.m. \(25^\circ \text{F}\) | \(17^\circ \text{F}\) | \(8^\circ \text{F}\) Tyler says the temperature dropped faster between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. Mai says the temperature dropped faster between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Who do you agree with? Explain your reasoning.

Takeaway:
Compare and interpret rates of change.

Steps:
1. Display task for all to see.
2. Give 2 minutes for quiet work on the question.
3. Discuss as a whole class.
4. Select 1-2 students to explain their reasoning.
5. Record and display student explanations.
6. Ask if anyone changed their mind, and invite them to share why.


Activity 1: Drop Some More
Timing: 20 minutes

Task Statement:
The table and graph show a more complete picture of the temperature changes on the same winter day. The function \(T\) gives the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, \(h\) hours since noon. \(h\) | \(T(h)\) 0 | 18 1 | 19 2 | 20 3 | 20 4 | 25 5 | 23 6 | 17 7 | 15 8 | 11 9 | 11 10 | 8 11 | 6 12 | 7 Graph of discrete points, \(x \)  \(y\) plane, origin \(O\). Horizontal axis scale 0 to 12 by 2’s, labeled “hours since noon”. Vertical axis scale 0 to 30 by 10’s, labeled “temperature in degrees F”. The points have coordinates (0 comma 18), (1 comma 19), (2 comma 20), (3 comma 20), (4 comma 25), (5 comma 23), (6 comma 17), (7 comma 15), (8 comma 11), (9 comma 11), (10 comma 8), (11 comma 6) and (12 comma 7). Image description: <p>Graph of discrete points, <span class="math">\(x y\)</span> plane, origin <span class="math">\(O\)</span>.</p> Find the average rate of change for the following intervals. Explain or show your reasoning.between noon and 1 p.m.between noon and 4 p.m.between noon and midnight Find the average rate of change for the following intervals. Explain or show your reasoning. between noon and 1 p.m. between noon and 4 p.m. between noon and midnight Remember Mai and Tyler’s disagreement? Use average rate of change to show which time period—4 p.m. to 6 p.m. or 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.—experienced a faster temperature drop.

Takeaway:
Understand that the average rate of change for a function over an interval is the slope of the line connecting the two points at each end of the interval.

Steps:
1. Display initial scatter plot with two data points (4pm, 10pm).
2. Discuss observed temperature change and rate of fall.
3. Show hourly data scatter plot from 4pm to 10pm.
4. Have students notice and wonder about the data; discuss hourly change.
5. Explain average rate of change concept, relating it to slope.
6. Give table and graph of temperatures noon to midnight.
7. Task students to find average rates of change for given intervals.
8. Synthesis: Students share methods, link to concept of slope.


Activity 2: Populations of Two States
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
The graphs show the populations of California and Texas over time. Graph of the populations of two states over time on a coordinate plane. Horizontal axis scale 1900 to 2010 by 10’s, labeled “year”. Vertical axis scale 0 to 40 by 10’s, labeled “population in millions”. California has a solid blue graph and Texas is a red dashed graph. California has the points (0 comma 2), (1940 comma 5), (1970 comma 20) and (2010 comma 37). Texas has the points (0 comma 4), (1940 comma 5), (1960 comma 10), (1970 comma 11) and (2010 comma 25). Image description: <p>Graph of the populations of two states over time on a coordinate plane. </p> Estimate the average rate of change in the population in each state between 1970 and 2010. Show your reasoning.In this situation, what does each rate of change mean? Estimate the average rate of change in the population in each state between 1970 and 2010. Show your reasoning. In this situation, what does each rate of change mean? Which state’s population grew more quickly between 1900 and 2000? Show your reasoning.

Takeaway:
"Understand and interpret the average rate of change from a graph."

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs.
2. Show the graph of populations for California and Texas from 1900 to 2010.
3. Ask students to estimate and calculate the average rates of change for each state from 1970 to 2010.
4. Discuss why different pairs might have slightly different results.
5. Compare the population growth trends visually between 1900 and 2000.
6. Conclude with questions about interpreting average rate of change and comparing trends using different representations.
