Warm-Up: Bagel Shop
Timing: 15 minutes

Task Statement:
Image description: <p>Trays of bagels at a bagel shop.</p> Image description: <p>Fresh bagels sign. Prices listed. 1 bagel, 1 dollar 25 cents. 6 bagels, 6 dollars. 9 bagels, 8 dollars. 12 bagels, 10 dollars.</p> A customer at a bagel shop is buying 13 bagels. The shopkeeper says, “That would be $16.25.” Jada, Priya, and Han, who are in the shop, all think it is a mistake. Jada says to her friends, “Shouldn’t the total be \$13.25?” Priya says, “I think it should be \$13.00.” Han says, “No, I think it should be \$11.25.” Explain how the shopkeeper, Jada, Priya, and Han could all be right. Your teacher will give you instructions for completing the table. numberof bagels | \(\phantom{BEST PRICE}\) 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |

Takeaway:
Differentiate between a relationship that forms a function and one that does not.

Steps:
1. Group students in 4s. Quietly think about the first question for a few minutes.
2. Share thoughts in groups for a couple of minutes. Discuss how each person could be right.
3. Display and record the reasoning behind each price. 
4. Complete the table with the "best price" in the second column.
5. Display tables for possible and best prices, and discuss why \


Activity 1: Be Right Back!
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Three days in a row, a dog owner tied his dog’s 5-foot-long leash to a post outside a store while he ran into the store to get a drink. Each time, the owner returned within minutes. Image description: <p>Dog with leash tied to a post.</p> The dog’s movement each day is described here. Day 1: The dog walked around the entire time while waiting for its owner. Day 2: The dog walked around for the first minute and then laid down until its owner returned. Day 3: The dog tried to follow its owner into the store but was stopped by the leash. Then, it started walking around the post in one direction. It kept walking until its leash was completely wound up around the post. The dog stayed there until its owner returned. Each day, the dog was 1.5 feet away from the post when the owner left. Each day, 60 seconds after the owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post. Your teacher will assign one of the days for you to analyze. Sketch a graph that could represent the relationship between the dog’s distance from the post, in feet, and time, in seconds, since the owner left. Day \(\underline{\hspace{0.5in}}\) Image description: <p>Blank grid. Horizontal axis from 0 to 160 by 20’s, time in seconds. Vertical axis from 0 to 6, distance from post in feet.</p>

Takeaway:
Identify and understand that the relationship between time and the dog’s distance from the post is a function.

Steps:
1. Arrange groups of 4.
2. Read problem aloud, ask: “What is this situation about?” Discuss.
3. Read again, list measurable quantities.
4. Read a third time, reveal question: “Sketch a graph for dog’s distance from post over time.”
5. Discuss graph features, show example.
6. Assign each group to graph dog’s movement for a specific day (1, 2, or 3).
7. Share and explain graphs to the class.
8. Discuss why the relationship is a function: one distance per time.
9. Emphasize independent (time) and dependent (distance) variables.


Activity 2: Talk about a Function
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Here are two pairs of quantities from a situation you’ve seen in this lesson. Each pair has a relationship that can be defined as a function. time, in seconds, since the dog owner left and the total number of times the dog has barked time, in seconds, since the owner left and the total distance, in feet, that the dog has walked while waiting Choose one pair of quantities, and express their relationship as a function. In that function, which variable is independent? Which one is dependent? Write a sentence of the form “\(\underline{\hspace{0.5in}}\) is a function of \(\underline{\hspace{0.5in}}\).” Sketch a possible graph of the relationship on the coordinate plane. Be sure to label and indicate a scale on each axis, and be prepared to explain your reasoning. Image description: <p>Blank grid with axes. Origin O.</p>

Takeaway:
Understand the definition of a function and practice identifying independent and dependent variables in a relationship.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs.
2. Each student analyzes one of two given quantity pairs.
3. Give a few minutes for quiet work, then partners share functions and graphs.
4. Ensure listening partners focus on independence, dependence, and graph scale.
5. Hold a brief whole-class discussion on reasonableness and graph types.
6. Select 1-2 students with different graphs to explain their thinking to the class.
