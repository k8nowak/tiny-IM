Takeaway:
Understand that the units chosen for the axes affect the interpretation of graphs and determine if they represent realistic functions.

Steps:
1. Show flag ceremony pictures and describe flag raising.
2. Arrange students in pairs; give task statement and graphs.
3. Quiet time: students think about reasonable units and function representation.
4. Discuss units and functions briefly as a class.
5. Assign pairs 1-3 graphs to interpret and explain.
6. Whole-class discussion on graph interpretations and realism.
7. Discuss why the vertical line graph doesn't represent a function.


Activity 2: Flag Raising (Part 2)
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Your teacher will show a video of a flag being raised. Function \(H\) gives the height of the flag over time. Height is measured in feet. Time is measured in seconds since the flag is fully secured to the string, which is when the video clip begins. On the coordinate plane, sketch a graph that could represent function \(H\). Be sure to include a label and a scale for each axis. Image description: <p>A blank graph with grid, origin O. The horizontal axis contains 13 units, beginning at 0. The vertical axis contains 8 units, beginning at 0.</p> Use your graph to estimate the average rate of change from the time the flag starts moving to the time it reaches the top. Be prepared to explain what the average rate of change tells us about the flag.

Takeaway:
Understand how to create and interpret graphs representing real-world scenarios, specifically focusing on estimating the average rate of change.

Steps:
1. Show the students a flag-raising video.
2. Sketch a graph of flag height over time.
3. Include labels and scales for each axis.
4. Estimate the average rate of change using the graph.
5. Select students to share and explain their graphs.
6. Discuss similarities, differences, key features, and rate of change.


Activity 3: Two Pools
Timing: 20 minutes

Task Statement:
To prepare for a backyard party, a parent uses two identical hoses to fill a small pool that is 15 inches deep and a large pool that is 27 inches deep. The height of the water in each pool is a function of time since the water is turned on. An image with two pools. The larger pool has a ladder and a girl filling it with a hose. The smaller pool is smaller and inflatable and being filled with a hose. Image description: <p>Two pools. </p> Here are descriptions of three situations. For each situation, sketch the graphs of the two functions on the same coordinate plane so that \(S(t)\) is the height of the water in the small pool after \(t\) minutes and \(L(t)\) is the height of the water in the large pool after \(t\) minutes. In both functions, the height of the water is measured in inches. Situation 1: Each hose fills one pool at a constant rate. When the small pool is full, the water for that hose is shut off. The other hose keeps filling the larger pool until it is full. Image description: <p>A blank graph, origin O. Horizontal axis, time in minutes, scale from 0 to 20 by 2s. Vertical axis, height in inches, from 0 to 30 by 3s.</p> Situation 2: Each hose fills one pool at a constant rate. When the small pool is full, both hoses are shut off. Situation 3: Each hose fills one pool at a constant rate. When the small pool is full, both hoses are used to fill the large pool until it is full. Image description: <p>A blank graph, origin O. Horizontal axis, time in minutes, scale from 0 to 20 by 2s. Vertical axis, height in inches, from 0 to 30 by 3s.</p>

Takeaway:
"Understand and practice creating and interpreting graphs of functions based on verbal descriptions and assumptions."

Steps:
1. Group students in pairs and have them read the Task Statement.
2. Allow a few minutes of quiet time for students to sketch their graphs.
3. Partners discuss assumptions and reasonableness of their graphs, then revise based on feedback.
4. Select students to share their graphs and graphing decisions.
5. Discuss key questions about assumptions: hose rates, start times, pool dimensions, and water rise.
6. Invite more students to share varied graphs and reasoning, emphasizing comparative correctness.


Activity 4: The Bouncing Ball
Timing: 15 minutes

Task Statement:
Your teacher will show you one or more videos of a tennis ball being dropped from 6 feet off the ground. Here are some still images of the situation. The height of the ball is a function of time. Suppose the height is \(h\) feet, \(t\) seconds after the ball is dropped. Use the blank coordinate plane to sketch a graph of the height of the tennis ball as a function of time.To help you get started, here are some pictures and a table.
