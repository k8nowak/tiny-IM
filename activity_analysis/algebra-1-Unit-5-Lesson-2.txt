Warm-Up: Back to the Post!
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Here are the graphs of some situations you saw before. Each graph represents the distance of a dog from a post as a function of time since the dog owner left to purchase something from a store. Distance is measured in feet, and time is measured in seconds. Day 1 Image description: <p>Nonlinear function. time in seconds and distance from post in feet.<br> </p> Day 2 Image description: <p>Nonlinear function. time in seconds and distance from post in feet.</p> Day 3 Use the given graphs to answer these questions about each of the three days:How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3:How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3:The owner returned 160 seconds after he left. How far away was the dog from the post at that time?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3:How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point from the post it could reach?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: Use the given graphs to answer these questions about each of the three days: How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: How far away was the dog from the post 60 seconds after the owner left? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: How far away was the dog from the post when the owner left? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: The owner returned 160 seconds after he left. How far away was the dog from the post at that time?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: The owner returned 160 seconds after he left. How far away was the dog from the post at that time? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point from the post it could reach?Day 1:Day 2:Day 3: How many seconds passed before the dog reached the farthest point from the post it could reach? Day 1: Day 2: Day 3: Consider the statement, “The dog was 2 feet away from the post after 80 seconds.” Do you agree with the statement? What was the distance of the dog from the post 100 seconds after the owner left?

Takeaway:
Understand the need for precise notation to accurately communicate about functions.

Steps:
1. Provide graphs to students.
2. Students answer specified questions for each graph.
3. Discuss as a class:
   - How far from the post after 60 seconds, 0 seconds, and 160 seconds.
   - Time to reach farthest point from the post.
   - Analyze statements about dog’s distance.
4. Highlight the importance of specifying which graph/day each response refers to.
5. Explain the need for precise function notation.


Activity 1: A Handy Notation
Timing: 15 minutes

Task Statement:
Let’s name the functions that relate the dog’s distance from the post and the time since its owner left: function \(f\) for Day 1, function \(g\) for Day 2, function \(h\) for Day 3. The input of each function is time in seconds, \(t\). Use function notation to complete the table.	day 1day 2day 3a. distance from post 60 seconds after the owner leftb. distance from post when the owner leftc. distance from post 160 seconds after the owner left | day 1 | day 2 | day 3 a. distance from post 60 seconds after the owner left |  |  | b. distance from post when the owner left |  |  | c. distance from post 160 seconds after the owner left |  |  | Describe what each expression represents in this context:\(f(15)\)\(g(48)\)\(h(t)\) Describe what each expression represents in this context: \(f(15)\) \(g(48)\) \(h(t)\) The equation \(g(120) = 4\) can be interpreted to mean: “On Day 2, 120 seconds after the dog owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.” What does each equation mean in this situation?\(h(40) = 4.6\)\(f(t) = 5\)\(g(t) = d\) The equation \(g(120) = 4\) can be interpreted to mean: “On Day 2, 120 seconds after the dog owner left, the dog was 4 feet from the post.” What does each equation mean in this situation? \(h(40) = 4.6\) \(f(t) = 5\) \(g(t) = d\)

Takeaway:
Learn to use and interpret function notation effectively.

Steps:
1. Explain function notation with dog distance example.
2. Display and critique sample response: “\\(f(15)\\) is the function when the input is 15.” 
3. Annotate unclear parts with student input.
4. Students revise the sample response with partners (2-4 mins). 
5. Display/edit revised drafts as a class.
6. Complete the table with function notation for given scenarios.
7. Students interpret given function equations in context.
8. Discuss and reinforce reading/analyzing function notation.


Activity 2: Birthdays
Timing: 10 minutes

Task Statement:
Rule \(B\) takes a person’s name as its input and gives their birthday as the output. input | output Abraham Lincoln | February 12 | | | Rule \(P\) takes a date as its input and gives a person with that birthday as the output. input | output August 26 | Katherine Johnson | | | Complete each table with three more examples of input-output pairs. If you use your name as the input to \(B\), how many outputs are possible? Explain how you know. If you use your birthday as the input to \(P\), how many outputs are possible? Explain how you know. Only one of the two relationships is a function. The other is not a function. Which one is which? Explain how you know. For the relationship that is a function, write two input-output pairs from the table using function notation.

Takeaway:
Understand the definition and characteristics of a function, specifically that each input corresponds to a unique output, and apply function notation accurately.

Steps:
1. Arrange students in pairs.
2. Introduce Rule \\(B\\) (name to birthday) and Rule \\(P\\) (birthday to name).
3. Students complete input-output tables for \\(B\\) and \\(P\\) with three examples.
4. Students discuss and explain the outputs for their name in \\(B\\) and birthday in \\(P\\).
5. Identify which relationship is a function and why.
6. Write two input-output pairs from the function table using function notation.
